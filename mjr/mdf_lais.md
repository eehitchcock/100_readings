19-#Marie de France - Lais

##Introduction

- Marie de France: we only know her __name__ and that she wrote three works: the _Lais_, the _Fables_, the _Espurgatoire_.

- The _Lais_ are translated from the Anglosaxon "pseudo-Alfred".

- Marie was probably working at the court of Henry II - hence her __foreign__ name; Henry II becomes king of __England__ and __France__ in 1154.

	- Henry II was considered as a restless king, constantly on the __move__; he would never cease travelling from the continent to the island, and from the island to the continent.

- The main __literary__ preoccupation of MdF seems to be the her conciliation of __sacred__ and __profane__ matter.

- THe __context__ of her writing was the __irresistible__ spread of the __Arthurian matter__; similarly, her work is in contrast with the __classical__ content and inspiration of some _Romans_ (_Eneas_, _Thebes_). Marie is closer to the _former_ (Chretien's knights).

- __Lai__ (from the __Celtic/Irish__ _Laid_) was originally a __song__.

- Written between 1160 and 1170.

- First French work by a __woman author__; first French work of _short fiction_.

##Prologue

- __1__: speaking immediately becomes writing, and writing is __amplified__, magnified, in a __bookish__ world of _authors_, critics, and glosses. MdF seems well aware of the context of __literary production__ and __literary interpretation__ to which / on which her works depends.

- __pr. 24-27__: __ethical concerns__: writing, reading and learning make you a _more virtuous_ person. A better person. And they prevent _evil_ and _grief_.

- __pr. 29-30__: "d'aukune bone estoire faire | et de latin en romanz traire" - __make__ stories (and) translate them from _Latin_ into _Romance_.

- __pr. 33-34__: the __Lais__ as a genre are what make her effort special.

- __pr. 35-36__: the purpose of __composing__ (and translating) is twofold: they allow for a __memory__ of the story itself, and form a __memory__ of its _author_.

- __Pr. 41-42__: "Rimé en ai e fait ditié | Soventes fiez en ai veillié!"

- __pr. 43__: a dedication to the good king - Henry II.

##I. Guigemar

- __Gu. 1-2__: A strong attention to the __making__ of a _story_ - the _quality of form_.

- __Gu. 8-9__: In a way, Marie is constantly becoming a __character__ of her own world - an actor comparable to the protagonists of her stories.

- __Gu. 13-14__: __Envie__ and the evil dog - "malvais chien, coart, falus"

- __Gu. 19-23__: Origin of the __Lais__ in __Bretagne__. They are said to be _true_, and they have been transmitted orally. But there are also written documents about them. The continuity between _written_ and _spoken_ is certainly remarkable.

- __Gu. 25__: the setting of the story is said to be the __Bretagne__ la Menur.

- __Gu. 27-33__: from the _Land_ to its _Lord_, from the _lord_ to its _vassal_ (Knight).

- __Gu. 37__: Guigemar is "le dancel" - the noble boy.

- __Gu. 52-54__: the synctactic and rhetorical structure of the verse follows a __binary__ pattern; __endiadis__ seems to be the leading device.

- __Gu. 61-68__: __Nature__ punishes the _Lord_, and the punishment is an impossibility to love (inability? unavailability?). "Il n'aveit de ceo talent." The man is perfect, but he cannot be until he enters the society of __monogamous, heterosexual love__. Guigemar keeps his intention to love a __secret__: "Nuls se pout aperceiver ke il volsit amur aveir." His __will__ is well determined, the problem is __nature__ (desire? body?)

- __Gu. 91__: appearance of a wonderful beast - a white doe; a female deer with stags? a female deer with antlers?

- __Gu. 94__: here is probably the __crucial magical episode__ of the story.

	- It should be noted how quick paced the narrative form is. THere is a lively usage of __tenses__ - historical (or vivid) present, past __perfect__ that simply jumps when juxtaposed with the imperfect. The lesson is Latin - but Marie is simply concerned with briliant, expressive story telling. THe only visible recurrent trope is __endiadis__. The line coincides with the __syntax__ constantly. The meter is __octosyllabic couplet__.

- __Gu. 100-104__: __Direct discourse__ is another surprising device for __vividness__. Here the hurt doe curses Gui. and his wound - he strangely seems to __have deserved__ the _curse_.

- __Gu. 152__: Description of a wonderful object - the __ship__. The following lines are devoted to the __ekphrasis__ of this exotic piece of art - a __foreign__ object in a dock that is not supposed to host __foreigners__. "En la cuntree nel pais | N'out unkes mes oi parler | ke neufs peust ariver."

- __Gu. 140__: the __wound__ has a strong influence on the __character__, on the __narrator__, and on the __reader__.

- __Gu. 171__: the __ekphrasis__ of the precious ship becomes an __ekphrasis__ of a beautiful bed. _Eros_ is again connected to a _foreign seduction_ - and perhaps a foreign _threat_.

- __Gu. 188__: the bed becomes the _vessel_ - and again the emphasis on the __wound__ should be emphasized - "Repose sei, sa plaie doelt" (189)

	- The __wound__ is at the same time the _obscure seduction_ of _sex_ and the inevitable _threat_ of _death_.

- __Gu. 199__: the __wound__ is also the _aventure_ - "Sufrir li estuet l'aventure."

- __Gu. 204__: Again, the rhetorical greatness of Marie's style is all devoted to storytelling. Here we have a __prolexis__ that becomes a whole narrative in the __future tense__: "ainz le vespre ariverat..."

- __Gu. 214__: the presence of __Nature__ as an _inevitable force_ - or, better, as the condition which shapes those _traits of personality_ - of _individuality_ - of _character_ - that cannot be bent or __transformed by will or reason__. "Nature" is what you _cannot help but be_ - the __inevitable side of identity__. "Kar ceo purporte la Nature | Ke tust li vieil seient gelus."

- __Gu. 220__: here we have a _description of the Queen's prison_. A beautiful prison - again a combination of __exotic__ and __precious__. _Ekphrasis_. Enclosed chambers are always literary metaphors - they stand for a __book__, for a genre, for a __tradition__. Here the _chamber_ was painted by _Venus_, and it has episodes from the _Ars Amandi_ - le _Livre Ovide_ (239) - No, better still; the walls of the chamber depict _Venus_ as she is throwing Ovid's book [on sexual restraint] into the __fire__.

- __Gu. 240__: "En un fu ardant le get tout | e tuz iceus escumen gout | ki jamais al livre livreient" - __buring__ of the teaching of __restraint__.

- __Gu. 257__: A grotesque detail" the __keeper__ of the prison's keys is an _evirated priest_: "le plus bas membres out perduz | autrement ne fust pas creuz."

- __Gu. 261__: Amazing transition - from the youth and the ship to the lady in the garden. __Change in perspective__. The two girls see the ship - now _Guigemar_ is the __foreigner__ - the exotic presence - the _stranger_.

- __Gu. 277__: the detail of the __lady__ taking of her _mantel_. The story easily becomes a long narrative of _mutual seduction_: "sun mantel oste la pulcele | entre en la neif, ki mut fu bele." A series of elaborate metaphors for a hymeneus - for __defloration__ - discovery of _sex_ - and _death_.

- __Gu. 282__: And indeed - "pale le vit, mort le quira": Guigemare __seems dead__.

- __Gu. 283-85__: Notice the interaction between the queen and her __handsmaid__ - typical of subsequent developments of the genre as well (up to Shakespeare).

- __Gu. 348__: the Queen hopes that the old man will __burn__. The old man could also stand for the __castrating ingerence__ of the __church__ in sexual policy.

- __Gu. 378__: Guigemar is now hidden in the secret chamber that doubles as a __prison__ - he sleeps in the _handsmaid's bed_.

- __Gu. 379__: the __analogy__ between the _physical wound_ and the _seduction_ is here reiterated - "mes l'amur l'ot feru al vif". __Tender__ open wound. Later - "De sa plaie nul mal se sent | Mut suspire anguisement" (383-384)

- __Gu. 392__: the __love is mutual__; reciprocity of seduction - different __metaphors__: the _piercing_ (for Guig.), the _fire_ (for the Queen).

- __Gu. 399__: Here we have a wonderful __monologue__, expressing Guigemar's inner doubts. This simple monologue (7 lines) is the heart of the lai - __its exact center__.

- __Gu. 409-410__: __Endurance__ seems to be the key factor here - what Gu. realizes is that __avanture__ is simply something that one has to __endure__ - grief that is inevitable, and that should be accepeted as such soon. "E dit que suffrir li estoet | Kar issi fait ki mes ne poet" - Suffering suits those who cannot do better. There seems to be a Boethian undertone here. _Changing fortune and acceptance_.

- __Gu. 430__: Here we have _Amur_ as an agent of __grief__; it affects both the queen and Guigemar. The chief problem of this section is __knowledge__. THe handsmaid is the only character who can understand the __hidden feelings of love__ by observing their _outward manifestations_ (signs - symptoms).

- __Gu. 451-453__: A demonstration of the potential __boethian__ reading, ad of MdF's wonderful simplicity - "ceste amur sereit covenable | si vus amdui feussez estable: | vus estes bels e ele est bele." The real issue is __stability__ - and _form_ (appearance, beatuty) corresponds to _content_ (feeling, virtue).

- __Gu. 467__: again __fine__ psychological detail and __masterful__ use of _interior voices_; monologues and indirect discourse. "Saveir voleit quei cil feseit | si il veillout u il dormeit | pur ki amur sis quors ne fine." Simplicity of style - few powerful elements, devotion to __narrative__.

- __Gu. 478__: the _foreigner_'s fear: "pur ceo qu'il ert d'estrange terre | aveit pour, s'il li mustrast | qu'el l'enhaist e esloinast"

- __Gu. 483__: a few lines later, the __overarching__ system of _metaphors_ is made __explicit__: "Amur est plaie dedenz cors | E si ne pient nient dehors | Ceo est un mal ki lunges tient, | Pur ceo que de Nature vient." Nature had forbidden love - had precluded Guigemar from it - but now Nature - again - is binding him to love. The following lines contain some __instructions__ about its correct regulation - loyalty and value.

- __Gu. 501__: Guigemar reveals his feelings to the Queen; the narrative becomes __dialogue__.

- __Gu. 533__: Marie alludes to _sexual intercourse_ with special tact: "bien sur convience del surplus | de ceo que li autre cest en us"

- __Gu. 538__: Here we find an explicit __Boethian referent__: the wheel of Fortune, substituting _nature_ and _Amur_ - "Mes Fortune, ki ne s'oblie | Sa roe turne en poi d'inre | l'un met desuz, l'autre desure."

- __Gu. 546__: strange sense of __omen__ in the queen's words. __Future tense__.

- __Gu. 564__: Another conventional __motive__ of the __romance__ (and the _fabliaux_?): the _knotted shirt_ and the love pawn; "le pleit fait en teu mesure, | nule femme nel deffereit | si force u cutel ni meteit."

- __Gu. 577__: The two lovers are discovered __on the same day__: "ce jur furent aparceu." Great detail.

- __Gu. 586__: Marie seems to feel sympaty for the _Lord of the Castle_ as well - "Quant li sires l'ad entendu | Unques mes tant dolenz ne fu!"

- __Gu. 595__: There is a __hint of realism__ - the realism of _fabliaux_ - domestic, and, in a way, trivializing - in the weapon that Guigemar snatches to protect himself from the soldiers - "une grosse perche de sap | u suleient pendre li drap | pris en ses mains e sis atent." There is something __ridicolous__ in this _concrete detail_.

- __Gu. 620__: Again - Marie's grace is in sythesis and colour - a _quick, vivid narrator_. "La barge trovent, enz l'ent mis | od lui s'ent vet en sun pais."

- __Gu. 624__: the dame (queen?) prays God; it's the first __explicit__ reference to it in the narrative - "et prie Deu omnipotent | qu'il li dunait hastive mort" - actually, it is Guigemar who prais, on a ship that seems _allegorical_.

- __Gu. 655__: the playful, sensual implications of the _knotted shirt_ are perhaps worthy of more attention. Are there sensual references here?

- __Gu. 673__: here we have a mysterious, almost supernatural, instance of __aventure__ - without any specific human intervention, the door to the lady's prison (a _degraded_ version of the original) has disappeared. "Ne treve cleif ne sereure | fors s'en eissi; par aventure..."

- __Gu. 689__: Here we have a specific reference to a __land__ and to a _ruler_: Bretaigne and Meriadu. Again the point of view shifts, and we perceive the ship approaching the _foreign shores_ from the perspective of its inhabitant.

- __Gu. 737-738__: Here we have an apparent __attempted rape__ - the breaking of the laces is accomplished, but not that of the _belt_.

- __Gu. 746__: __war__ is a _persistent context_, an unchangeable element of the _background_.

- __Gu. 748__: Guigemar is one of Meriaduc's peers and friends. They belong to the same _social world_ - and they are, perhaps, __mirroring figures__ (the only named ones).

- __Gu. 773__: the two lovers _meet again_. Another touching __monologue__ for Guigemar. THere's some casual sexism as well: "femmes se resemblent asez."

- __Gu. 789__: Again, the two lovers are contrasted by a jealous third presence. __Meriadus__ and the queen seem to be a functionally established __couple__ by now. Again, too, Marie feels sympathy for the jealous man: "dolenz en fu, il ne pot plus."

- __Gu. 822__: Like the unfortunate episode that has separated them, the __fortunate__ one that brings them back together is __aventure__ - "queil aventure."

- __Gu. 848-850__: jealousy is the trigger of violence - and this violence is assimilated to - compared to - __war__. Here the romance acquires a __political__ dimension. It bears historical resemblance to the present.

- __Gu. 859__: The __decisive element__ of the ending is the loyalty due by Guigemar's vassals to their land; the romance - and its meditations on fortune - is resolved through history, diplomacy, and politics.

- __Gu. 873__: The conclusion is striking: Guigemar decides to side with Meriadu's enemy, and he sieges Meriadu's castle with his army in order to slay the lord and snatch away the nameless queen. This murder could even resemble an act of __revenge__ and betrayal. THe rythm of the section is also especially frantic, and the ending seems abrupt - leaving the two lovers almost on the side.

##II. Equitan

- __Eq. 1-2__: two elements are here _reiterated_: the __nobility of the bretons__ and the __mnemonic and celebratory function__ of their lais, records of _aventures_.

- __Eq. 16-20__: The __narrative__ premise of the story combines the devotion to the ideal of _chivalrie_ with the __danger__ of _unrestrained love_. The two are __not__ mutually exclusive.

- __Eq. 21-28__: The theme of __feudal__ loyalty returns here; Equitan spends his time _abroad_, and leaves a "senseschal" behind at every time; is this a reference to __Henry II__?

- __Eq. 29-41__: Again the themes of love and __misogyny__ (love is always extramarital) become mixed with those of __loyalty__ to the lord. _Forbidden love_.

- __Eq. 64__: Again the accurate symptomatology of love; again the __careful, masterful__ use of _indirect discourse_ and _monologue_. It is the mode of __ethical doubt__.

- __Eq. 71__: and this is the _Vergilian_ conflict between erotic satisfaction (or even happiness) and devotion to the __political body__ - _duty_ and _selfishness_.

- __Eq. 87-88__: Here are two of the best lines so far: "suls ne la peot pas li tenir! | certes, jeo voil a li parir!" Equitan projects his will onto the other characters.

- __Eq. 114-116__: Here the alternative to __love__ - satisfied _love_ - is stressed - it is __death__ - emphasized bu the __repetition__ of _meort_/_mort_ and the rhyme with _confort_.

- __Eq. 137__: A wonderful twist - the __prolexis__ had anticipated a _misogynystic content_, where only the woman would have been to blame - but the speech that she she uses to dissuade the king is _perfectly rational_, and very convincing. The king is to blame; the lady is the voice of __rationality__ and __virtue__.

- __Eq. 150__: dialogue and __debate__ seems as well to be another frequent mode for the _Lais_. Here we have one about _loving above (or below) one's condition_.

- __Eq. 184__: the pace here becomes - again - so quick as to seem __abrupt__.

- __Eq. 195-196__: Here the alternation between the various motives is clearly exposed; the vassal holds the __political__ role, while the king keeps the __private__ (and his excuse his __deliberately physiological__ - he has his body drained); the vassal occupies the space of __history__, the king that of __romance__ (duty, eros).

- __Eq. 232-234__: Now the __clandestine__ couple is planning the __murder__ of the _diligent seneschalc_, the only character truly concerned with _history and politics_; it is a sort of __perverse regicide__ - and the man seems the single righteous character.

- __Eq. 244-246__: Here we have an interesting reference to the _two men_ - their bodies - bathing.

-  __Eq. 253__: the __method__ chosen is especially __cruel__: a burning bath, to have him "escadeuz" e "malmis."

- __Eq. 296-299__: Equitan's death is __abrupt__, violent - and somewhat _surprising_. There is something __ridiculous__ in his forgetfulness and in his __shame__. Similarly violent is the way in which the vassal pushes his wife into the tub: there is not much __nobility in these Bretons__: no character is saved - none is redeemable (positive).

- __Eq. 308__: Marie invites us to draw a __moral__ - reisun - from the exemplary tale - it is a general __admonition__ against violence: "tels purcace le mal d'autrui | dunt tuz i mals revert sur lui." At the end of the story, the woman is perhaps the true victim: reasonable, virtuous, and forced to __love__ and __suffer__.

##III. Fresne (Ash tree)

- __1-2__: A very laconic introduction; these probably functioned morea as _titles_.

- __19-20__: Marie's attention to __realistic__ detail is always especially remarkable; here "li riches hum sist al mangier | a tant es vuz le messagier!"

- __27-29__: The two women are juxtaposed: one is virtuous, the other wicked. __Pairs__ of _contrasting_ - though _mirroring_ - characters are a recurrent device in the __lais__.

- __36-42__: Here the __adventure__ of giving birth to a pair of __twins__ (another _pair_!) is __misintepreted__. THe characters of the _Lais_ can __utter__ and even __argue__ for what is clearly __false__ - a polyphony that includes __deception__.

- __55-56__: In any case, her claim is so _absurd_ that nobody believes her.

- __61-64__: Nobody except for her __idiotic husband__; misogyny is, again, _stated_ and then __upturned__, falsified by the circumstances.

- __76-80__: Again, notice the use of the _monologue_ (soliloquy?); similarly remarkable are the fact that _one discourse_ can become __universal prejudice__, and that the event of birth is - again - referred to as an "__aventure__." "Certes james ne me crerrunt, | des que ceste aventure orrrunt | car ceo mesme me jugai | de tutes femmes mes parlai" Prejudice is __reflexive__.

- __92__: "Un des enfanz m'estes murdriz" - __ferocious__ deduction; the best resolution of this doubt is __murder-filicide__.

- __135__: A realistic description of the path leading from the __castle__ into the __woods__, then from the woods to the __countryside__ and the __monastery__ where the infant is left. Between __civilization__ and __wilderness__.

- __149__: The setting is actually that of a "vile riche e dele," a city.

- __135-161__: these gestures are quick, concrete, expressive - few details convey a strong sense of __action__ in __secrecy__ - "hastivement est la venue"; even in the small variations allowed by the simple directness of her style, the syntax is flexible enough to produce meaningful inversions.

- __167__: Here enters the "__freisne__," the silent, vegetal (arboreal) protagonist of this narrative, strangely suggestive: "un freisne vi, le e branchu."

- __181-183__: Another synthetic, though highly expressive and realistic, sequence of gestures: "Icele nuit par tens leva, chaindelles, lampes albuma | les seins sona e l'us uvri." A simple character, yet incredibly vivid.

- __193__: His discourse blends into the __indirect discourse__. It becomes __indirect discourse__. We follow his thought at this point: from the infant found on the tree to his own daughter - "un fille ot, ki veove esteit."

- __214__: "L'aventure il veut canter | de l'enfant cum il le trovat." The aventure is what happens unexpectedly to the character of a story - it is the __furtuitous event__ that is worth telling, and in reaction to which your virtue and talent are measured.

- __228-230__: We now learn that __Freisne__ is also the infant child - the eponimous character being, therefore, both a __human__ and a __tree__.

- __246__: Here we have a __second named character__ - _Gurun_, male protagonist? By now we have learnt to distrust what Marie says when __introducing__ a character.

- __273__: This formula is __omnipresent__: "Tant li pria, tant li premist, qu'ele otria ceo ke il quist." These are stories of seduction - and seduction seems to be __always the same__.

- __283__: Marie is not afraid of __sexuality__. Here the grief that the __prioress__ would feel is that of seeing her daughter pregnant - "_Fuessez enceintes_."

- __295__: Here we have a masterful use of __analexis__ too - details that the reader did not know about how the __female protagonist__ was _raised_.

- __315__: Enter the theme of __feudalism__ - here the good __lord__ - Guron - suffers the pressure of his __vassals__, who want a different, nobler lady.

- __325__: Again, the conflict is between __loyalty__ to the __feudal__ system - history, politics - and __faitfhfulness__ to the imperatives of __love__.

- __335__: Enter a __second lady__ whose name is a tree - la codre - the _hazel tree_. The two are juxtaposed for their __fruifulness__ or __sterility__.

- __344-348__: Another __masterful analexis__: "Allas! Cum est mesavenu | Ke li prudume n'unt seu | L'aventure des dameiseles | Ki esteint sereurs gemeles!" We here discover that _hazel_ is _ash's_ sister.

- __359-388__: Here we find another example of Marie's empathy for __Villains__ (given that we consider them as such): a __long indirect discourse__ by the mother of the three daughters, who eventually repents her evil decision.

- __399__: the __decisive detail__ is realistic, even trivial: "li dras esteit d'un viel bofu"; an old piece of cloth; Marie treats these commendably.

- __405-408__: This character is the first virtuous one of the collection - a true __Christian Model__ (Fraisne); she follows the "_ercevekes_."

- __445__: We have here the conventional model of __recognition__ [_agnition_?] (and __evidence__).

- __418__: "Tuz li curages li fremi" - the emotion felt by the mother, and expressed through this powerful, yet simple image, is a striking sign of Marie's empathy.

- __452__: The _mother_ here bursts with strong feelings/emotions - so much that she __faints__. Strong emotions seems to prodcut __change__ in this world and these people.

- __488-489__: "Grant joie nus ad deus donee, ainz que li pechez fust dublez." __Doubling__ is one of the _motives_ of this story - but, we could argue, is also one of the __themes__ of the whole collection. Here it is a threat that the characters _avoid_, through a restoration of __balance__.

- __499-500__: "L'ercevekes ad cunseilie | que issi seit la noit laissie": the characters have to spend one night in the current situation of __imbalance__, before something can be done about it. There is a certain component of mystery here.

- __513__: Marie is eager to tell us that _Hazel_ witll marry too - and that is what mostly contributes to a sense of closure and perfect __balance__.

- __515-518__: The final four lineas again indicate explicitly the __title of the lai__ (probably an editiorial/scribal convention as well); the verb for composing is now the conventional "trove," which thransforms the _aventure_ of _history_ into the formal lai.

##IV. Bisclavret

- __1-4__: The first four lines refer to a double linguistic and cultural tradition; _Bisclavret_ is __Breton__, _Garwaf_ is __Norman__. The story is about duplicity, and the language emphasizes that (consider __endiadis__ as well).

- __9__: "Garvalf, ceo est beste selvage" - this looks like a simple __definiton__, and again stresses the __linguistic__ value of these _names_.

- __14__: "Del Bisclavret vus voil cunter." Bisclavret seems to be a __different creature__, perhaps not as _wild_, not as _foreign_, as Garwalf. To different names eventually seem to correspond very __different entities__.

- __19-22__: The protagonist of the story is initially presented as capable of a perfect balance between the __private__ (_erotic_) sphere and the __public__ (_political_) sphere. "de tuz ses veizins amez | femme ot espuse.."

- __25-26__: "Qu'en la semeine le perdeit | treis jours entiers" - like a character held by a dream, or lost in the space of a dream - Bisclavret is __somewhere else__ for _half of his week_ (_almost_ half). He's a __mind divided__.

- __30__: The endiadis is here an expression of Bisclavret happiness (contentment) when he is exploring the wilderness - "a sa meisun, joius e liez" (ambiguous?)

- __47-48__: "cunfort/mort" is one of the most frequent rhymes in the world of MdF.

- __51__: The second life of Bisclavret is initially compared to an _erotic transgression_: "mun escient que vus amez." Is this what the wife secretly hopes for?

- __63__: Fabulous self-profession: "Dame, jeo devienc Bisclavret." Blunt.

- __67-70__: Again, the wife's preoccupation seems always sexual: her first question is whether is goes in the wilderness clothed or all naked. Bisclavret's answer is again __memorably straighfroward__: "Dame, fet il, jeo vois tuz nuz."

- __87__: "Tant l'anguissa. tant le suz prist": insistence is the key to __confession__.

- __91__: Here we find an element that could bear more veiled symbolical valence: the hiding place for his clothes is a __religious place__ - "une vielz chapele." Is this "__aventure__" a metaphor for _life_ before _salvation_?

- __97__: Weird timing here: the woman becomes "de pour [fu] tute vermeille" only when she hears the details about the husband's stripping in the forest. Shame?

- __124-125__: "Issi fu Bliscravet trahiz | e par sa femme maubailiz": more __duplicity__ here; Bisclavret is both the wild state of the werewolf and the __civil name__ (proper name) of the __human__. His betrayal seems an act of __intolerance__, emargination (exclusion) - justified solely by __prejudice__.

- __143-144__: The __dogs__ and the __hunters__ are close to _murdering the protagonist_; "Tant que pur poi ne l'eurent pris | e tut decire e maumis."

- __154__: Bisclavret is truly almost __human__ - still almost human; here he is described as he acts __humanely__ towards the king: "ele ad sen d'hume | merci crie." By acting like a _submissive dog_ he is _almost human_.

- __160__: An interesting detail: the __King__ decides to __stop hunting__ completely for the day, after having discovered __one sensible beast__.

- __184__: "Bien s'aperceit que il l'amout." And that love is genuine - the _genuine_ love felt by a dog. Bisclavret seems happy in this _new condition_.

- __207-208__: "Ceo dient tust par la meisun | K'il nel fet mie sanz reisun" THe reason is here both human and animal (for the __reader__), and possibly exclusively animal (for the people at the castle). Another element of duplicity.

- __227__: Interestingly, "Bisclavret" can also be a sort of adjective - "femme Bisclavret"; by her acquaintance with the strange man, the woman has become strange too.

- __233-235__: Here is the most mysterious section of the poem. "Vers li curut cum enragiez | Oiez cum il est bien vengiez: | Le neis li esracha del vis." Another aspect of __metamorphosis__, forced onto the woman. Here, besides, Bisclavret proves his __humanity__, his rage can only be _revenge_.

- __248-249__: Indeed, the people at court immediately justify the animal's gesture as one possessing a deeper reason: "Par cele fei ke jeo vus des, | aukun curuz ad il vers li." This vassal si sure that this __violence__ has a _cause_.

- __259-260__: A proverbial saying about __Britain__ - "Meinte merveille avum veue | ki en Breitagne est avenue." The land of __marvels__ - because of its many cultures?

- __273-274__: Now the name "Bisclavret" indicates the __human__ nature of the _animal_ hosted by the king - "tres bien quivot e bien creeit | Que la beste Bisclavret seeit." The name certainly indicates a __human individual__.

- __283-288__: __Shame__ is one of the _main themes_ of this story. One of its main propellers. Here Bisclavret cannot show his metamorphosis to the court: "Que devant vus ses dras reveste | ne mut la semblance se d'este."

- __289__: The solution is therefore that of bringing the wolf into the king's chambers; _a wolf in the king's chambers_. He is thus clearly treated as a _human_.

- __293__: THe metamorphosis is never directly described; as if words would allow us to __see__.

- __313-314__: The ending is __memorable__ - it creates a new __strangeness__, a new _diversity_; "plussurs des femmes del lignage | c'est veritez, senz nes sunt neies | e sovent ierent esnaisees." Sympathy? Bitterness? Allegory?

##V. Lanval

- __5-10__: Here we have the first appearance of _King Arthur_; he is living abroad, since the __Scots__ and the __Picts__ are invading his _home country_. "En la tere de Logre entroent | e mut suvent la damagoent."

- __19__: Lanval enters the story as the _excluded_, forgotten knight.

- __23__: Lanval is also envied by most, and mostly for his own virtues.

- __28__: He is also __far__ from his _land_ - a __stranger__. "Mes luin ert de sun heritage!"

- __36-38__: And here Marie shows all her sympathy for the character: "Hum estrange recunseillez, | mut est dolenz en autre terre | quant il ne seit u sucure quere!" The motive of this tory seems to be __foreigness__ - a crucial one for Marie.

- __44-48__: Here we have a conventional _locus amoenus_; it is an _idealized, alluring version_ of the __exotic__ wilderness found, for instance, in Bisclavret.

- __61-64__: Lanval's vision is - unsurprisingly - one of __two women__. Double forms appear here too.

- __78-79__: A strange annotation about the _horse_ - at a moment when it seems totally irrelevant.

- __80-92__: The description of this __tent__ seems conventional; notice how, like in Guigemar, the detailed __ekphrasis__ of a beautiful artifact is always connected to the _exotic_.

- __97-106__: Here we have a description of the __lady lying__ on the bed; her _skin_ is emphasized, both when naked and when clothed by (with) the precious drapes.

- __111-112__: We find out that the lady is a __stranger__ here too: "pur vus vinc jeo fors de ma tere: de luinz sui venu quere!" Two foreigners meet.

- __116__: She is already in love with him, and she is there to ask for his love: her behavior reverts customary roles, and seems another sign of __foreigness__. It is an _inverted_ seduction; and it seems genuine and powerful here.

- __140-142__: There seems to be something __suspicious__ in Lanval's _new privilege_. Is it deserved? "Cum plus despendra richement, | E plus avra or e argent."

- __147-150__: The __condition__ for this _privilege_ is _secrecy_. The reason for this secrecy is unclear.

- __199-200__: The mode of __magic__, of _doubt_, of _romance_, is part of Lanval's reaction to the _exotic_ lady: "Esbaiz est, ne seit que creire, | Il ne la quide mie a veire." Also notice Marie's attention for __spaces__ and beliefs.

- __209-212__: __Anaphora__ is extremely __rare__ in Marie; here we have an example. Its function its expressive; she uses it to convey a sense of __abundance__.

- __220__: "Apres la feste seint Joseph": this story is the first one where __dates__ acquire strategic narrative importance. Is there a connection to __Arthur__?

- __225-228__: Here we have two canonical knights: Gawain and Ivain. Notice how Gawain is described as _seductive_ and _desired_. Not a good character here.

- __253__: Lanval prefers his __invisible lover__ to the women whom his companions have chosen. "Lanval s'en vait a une part | luin des autres; ceo li est tart | que s'aime puisse tenir, | baiser, acoler e sentir."

- __257__: What is the "other," foreign pleasure that Lanval has tried, and that keeps attracting him? "L'autrui joie prise petit, si il nen ad le seen delit." He is a lonely character, with a solitary passion. He resembles Guigemar (who could not love) and Bisclavret (for his _secret_).

- __280-282__: Here we have an explicit reference to Lanval's __latent homosexuality__; "asez le m'ad hum dit sovent | que des femmes n'avez talent/" And more: " Vellez avez bien afeitez | Ensemble od eus vus deduiez."

- __291-300__: Incredible twist here: Lanval confesses his secret only because he doesn't want to be considere an expert "__de cel mestier__." The queen behaves badly; but now Lanval insults her, and betrays his beloved.

- __319-320__: We have here a detailed description of the queen's __lies__. __Misogyny__ in action.

- __327-328__: There is little nobility in the King as well: he's prepared to __burn__ or __hang__ hi,.

- __383-384__: Here we have a brief glimpse of __feudal democracy__: the King asks for __advice__; he does so with "tuz ses hommes": subordinates, not peers.

- __391-392__: A __term__ is established for Lanval's life (just like in __SGGK__).

- __400__: "Walwains i vait, ki l'a plevi." Gawain is Lanval's protector here. The knights at court have suddenly become __sympathetic__ towards __Lanval__: is there any explicit justification for this change? __Misery__?

- __421-422__: Indeed, Lanval is suddenly _more likable_. And it is because of his troubles: "Mut furent tuit pur lui dolent | Jeo quid k'il en i ot teus sent."

- __427-428__: Lanval's __strangeness/foreigness__ is reiterated: "Del franc humme s'autre paus | Ki entre eus ert si entrepris." He's a __foreign prisoner__.

- __433__: The Duke of Cornwall is the __voice of submission__ to the king's will.

- __472-473__: The magical appearance of the _two ladies_ is here __reiterated__ and _amplified_.

- __509-510__: And it happens __again__: two ladies, riding horses, eerie and mysterious. This is a form of the __foreigness__ - an exotic presence __threatening__ and __alluring__.

- __531-532__: The crucial detail is that these creatures are __fairer__ than the queen.

- __548-549__: The __magical lady__ who seduces Lanval enters the scene _similarly_.

- __565-579__: This description is slow and detailed, like that of the __Green Knight__. The participation of the whole town is another sign of __strangeness__.

- __600__: A wonderful line: "Kar gariz sun quant jeo la vei!" Marie's mastery.

- __619-621__: The choice is __collective__ - and this detail resonates with the rest of the narrative: "n'i ad un sul ki n'ait jugie | que Lanval ad tut desrainie."

- __637-646__: A wonderful ending; Marie's use of __trivial__, concrete detail, is as masterful as usual; here the __marble__. And the island of __Avalon__ is the ultimate _strangeness_.

##VI. Deus Amanz

- __1-10__: Notice the familiar pattern: __exoticism__; __naming__, __language__; _duplicity_. "Veritez es ke en Neustrie | Que nus apelum Normandie."

- __13-16__: Same with the city of __Pistre__: "Des Pistreis la fist il numer | E Pistre la fit apeler." Naming is the __privilege of kings__; and it's for peoples.

- __19-20__: Marie here is truly concerned with __geography__; "la contree | que li vels de Pistre est nomee."

- __27-28__: Here we jave the recurring theme of the jealous father figure (also in Boccaccio); "Cunfortez fu par la meschine | Puis que perdue ot la reine."

- __40-56__: The king establishes an impossible __trial__ of __force__ for whom whishes to marry her.

- __80-98__: Noticeable alternation between __direct__ and __indirect discourse__. The story here __depends__ on the esceptionality of the geographical context (the _high mountain_). The two lovers try to _avoid the trial_.

- __103-112__: __exotic__ presence: a _woman_ in _Salerno_ who knows _medicine_ and _herbs_.

- __116__: The __strength__ required to complete the challenge is defined as __vertu__. The main male character of this story, therefore, is lacking in __vertu__.

- __131__: The youth is, apparently, from __another country__: "En sa cuntre en est acez."

- __161__: The _amanz_ is especially __young__: "Pur ceo qu'il iert de jeofne eage."

- __174-176__: One phenomenal detail (yet another example of Marie's vivid realism): the young woman __fasts__ to help her man. "Must se destreinst e mult juna | E amaigri pur alegier."

- __188-189__: Here a dramatic __prolexis__ (we actually already know about the __tragic ending__ of the _tale_, from the incipit): "meis jo creim que poi ne li vaille | kar n'ot en lui point de mesure." Measure as __virtue__.

- __192-193__: And here is the __tragic flaw__: not lack of _measure_ (the one of Alain de Lille) but __ubris__. The youth believes that he needs no outside help.

- __213-214__: And indeed - he had enough virtue to __die__ from it: "Sur le munt vint: tant se greva, ileoc chei, puis ne leva | Li quors del ventre s'en parti."

- __223-225__: Wonderful etiological ending: the __potion__ becomes the __nourishment__ of the land. "Li muns en fu bien arusez | Mut en ad este amendez | Meinte bone herbe i unt trovee | Ki del beivre orent racine." Notice that this filtre of __vertu__ was made by a _foreign woman_, for a _foreign man_ - the embodiment of their _superior virtue_.

- __236__: The woman dies as well, "li dols de lui al quor la tuche."

- __245__: After their tragic death, the youth become as well part of the __landscape__, in a _marble mausoleum_ placed on the _mountain_.

##VII. Yonec

- __1-4__: The _incipit_ is slightly different from the customary ones: we get the impression that the composition of the _lais_ is an __ongoing effort__ - a _single stretch_ that has to be completed. It is as if Marie was translating from - or referring to - a __finite volume__ - she will not stop until that is over - because __it will be over__. "Puisque des lais ai comencie, | Ja n'iert pur mon travail laissie; | Les aventures que j'en sai, | tut par rime les cunterai." Also notice that this is the beginning of the __second half__ of the book.

- __9-10__: The __incipit__ is closed with a __genealogical__ annotation: this story is about Yonec, but it starts with his father. __Etiology__ in action.

- __11-17__: Here we have __two__ details worth mentioning: the __number__ of _toponyms_, defining a peculiar __geography of the past__, and the "de nes trespas," a passage of __ships__ which already establishes a context of _foreigness_ and _exchange_.

- __26-32__: We have, again, the motive of the __tower__ (like in Guigemar), and the _jealous man_ guarding his wife. "Dedenz sa tur l-ad enserreie | En un grant chambre..."

- __41-44__: Like in Guigemar, there seems to be __no intercourse__ between the _old man_ and the _girl_. There seems to be _literal quotations_ from the first lai here; "n'i ot chamberlenc ne huissier | ki en la chambre osast entrer."

- __51-53__: The real story begins: "Ceo fu el meis d'avril entrant, | quand cil oiseil meinent lur chant." April, rebirth and _sexual awakening_ - just like in Chaucer.

- __67-68__: As the old woman leaves the room, we have the opening of a __great monologue__; the woman complains for her lack of _freedom_ and for her _captivity_ - not for the imposed marriage _per se_. Her first wish is indeed that of going to the church to attend the mass.

- __91-94__: A wonderful, somewhat __postmodern__ twist: the girl remembers that the country where she lives is _wonderful_ - full of "_aventures_ ki rehaitouent les pensis." Then she describes the __genre of romance__.

- __103-104__: And the invocation of a __literary genre__ and its _magical_, irralistic conventions, ends with a __prayer__ to the _Christian God_. "Si ceo peot estre e ceo fu, | [...] Deus, ki de tut ad poeste | Il fu face ma volonte." The _potential mode_ of the genre becomes part of God's own _omnipotence_.

- __106-112__: Here we have the _appearance_ of the __hawk__, and its _metamorphosis_ into a _knight_. The exotic, the supernatural, the miraculous, the literary: all in one.

- __127-128__: By now conventions have become almost __playful__ and __abstract__ in their constant repetition; here, for instance, the __motive__ of the _secret, distant lover_, who suddenly appears in the _woman's room_.

- __139__: The faith in God and the belief in the _conventions_ of the genre are here __melted__ into one imperative - "s'en deu creist e issi fust."

- __149-152__: And the __knight__ is not only a _divine_ creature; he is also a believer, an instrument of the _Christian God_. Follow specific references to _Genesis_ and the _original Sin_.

- __159-164__: Here we have the strangest request: the __knight__ wants to receive the _Communion_, the blessed _Host_, after having turned into an __image of the woman__.

- __167-168__: The knight here refuses to _touch_, embrace, or kiss the woman; saintly __chastity__.

- __184-188__: Here the knight receives the "__corpus domini__" and "le vin del chalice beu."

- __196__: A new emphasis on __foreigness__: "raler s'en voelt en sun pais."

- __203-204__: A negative __prolexis__: the two lovers, for the knight, will be discovered by the servant.

- __211-224__: The woman recovers __health__ and __beauty__: she's now happy about her captivity, because in the _tower_ she can meet him. Can this be a metaphor for the _consumption_ of __literature__? And a _blessing_ for it?

- __229__: MdF is careful about the ways in which her human characters transform __realistically__: here "esteit tuz sis semblanz changiez."

- __261-264__: Vivid realism in describing the old woman's hiding place: "dunc s'esteit la vielle levee | triers une cortine est alee." __Gesture__ and sense of __space__.

- __272__: Apparently the two lovers now sleep together: "e par paroile e par semblant."

- __278__: The metamorphosis of the knight is horrible in the eyes of the _old woman_.

- __279-296__: The "engins" prepared against the knight are gruesome and __cruel__ - especially because they work against his __animal__ form, not his human form - as if the _metamorphosis_ was a _handicap_, a form of disability. "Broches de fer fist granz furgier | e acerier le chief devant."

- __311-312__: Here we have the violent, bloody murder of the knight. We can only wonder whether "li sans vermeilz" springing from his heart is __human__ or __animal__.

- __319-322__: The knight speaks, but we don't know in which form. He finally blames the _woman_ for what has happened: "votre semblanz nus ocireit."

- __327-332__: Another __prolexis__, in _indirect discourse_ and pronounced by the knight: "de lui est enceinte d'enfant [...] Yonec numerle ferat."

- __345-348__: Here we have the __vivid__ detail of the _blood trail_: "a la trace del sanc s'est mise | ki del chevalier degotot | sur le chemin u ele alot."

- __350-353__: Here we have a __supernatural passage__ into another dimension, placed on the top of a hill. "En cele hoge ot une entree."

- __356-357__: The grass is drenched in blood. A foreign land, impregnated by the knight's presence.

- __360-364__: The __trail__ leads to a wonderful __city__, where everything is covered in __silver__. The description of the surroundings is suggestive and detailed. It is a _mirroring_ world, the _exotic_, again seductive and perhaps threatening.

- __380-387__: We have here three knights who are asleep in the same castle, and only one of them is the __hawk__. The motive seems __allegorical__ (Christian?).

- __415-424__: The knight gives her two supernatural gifts: a small ring for the king (it will make him __oblivious__) and his sword, for the son's revenge.

- __425-436__: Another long prolexis, by the hawk, and in indirect discourse __Prophecy__?

- __438__: The last gift: a __white robe__, that she has to wear immediately.

- __448-452__: One realistic detail, and one puzzling __hyperbole__: the _bells of the town_ announce the _king's death_, and the woman _faints four times_.

- __481-484__: The new family - with Yonec being young and strong - is led to a __foreign castle__ - "une abeie i ot dedenz | de tut religiuses genz."

- __409-508__: Here we have an _exotic ekphrasis_: the tomb of the knight, rich and beautiful.

- __521__: The places mentioned in this section are both in __Whales__.

- __535-546__: The ending is fast-paced, laconic, and - again - almost __abrupt__. The woman dies, and Yonec is quick to believe her story, and behead the king.

- __549-558__: Like Deuz Amanz, this story ends with __tragic death__ and a common _sepulcher_.

##VIII. Laustic

- __1-6__: The opening, like Bisclavret, emphasizes a double origin - French and English - combined with the __Breton__. __Etimology__ is a form of _etiology_. Here we are given the __name__ "en lur pais," then "russignol" (_franceis_) and "nihtegale" _en dreit engleis_. Does this imply a __diverse audience__?

- __10__: We have the _motive of the two knights here_. Doubles and duplicity.

- __19-23__: Both men are victorious, but one focuses on _manly feats_, the other one is _married_. The unmarried one eventually falls in love with the wife.

- __37-38__: We have here a detailed description of the _contiguous spaces_ where the two noblemen live. Marie's realism and sense of __space__; also _duplicity_ and, in a way, metaphor for _foreigness_ and _invasion_.

- __57-60__: Summer is - strangely enough for the context of this narrative - the moment when love has to cease; flowers and birds are threatening.

- __72__: "E de sun mantel s'afiblot": women are always _covering_ themselves or _stripping_.

- __85__: Since we know that "Laustic" is a Breton word, the sentemnce "Ki n'ot le laustic chanter" is multilingual; a synthesis.

- __89-90__: "Tant mi delit e tant le voil | Que jeo ne puis dormir de l'oil." The motive is pure __fabliaux__. And the _foreigness_ of the word gives a new connotation to this __innuendo__: foreign threat and _seduction_.

- __93-94__: Again the _hostility_ against the _foreigner_; and again a meditation about __freedom__ and __strangeness__. This is pure fabliaux in its potential innuendo: "D'une chose se purpensa: | Le laustic enginnera."

- __96-97__: "Il n'ot vallet en sa meisun | Ne face engin, reis u lacun" - every member of the household participates in the project of keeping the __stranger__ captive.

- __100__: "Tant que pris l'unt e retenu." Here we find a __twist__: the servants actually catch a __real__ _nightingale_, and not what it stands for.

- __114-116__: The dead body of the nightingale stains the dress of the woman: "un poi desur le piz devant"; blood on her heart. The cruel, realistic detail is also a __symbol__ for the woman's affection. The metaphor has been slaughtered. Here the __word__ created ambiguity - innuendo produced __violence__ over a creature.

- __135-136__: The __bird-word__ is indeed sent to her _lover_ "En un piece de samit | a or brusde e tut escrit." It works as a message, even when dead (or because it is dead?)

- __148-160__: The _bird-word_ becomes a _memory_ of lost loved, and eventually the __story__ itself - when it is "cuntee | ne pot estre longes celee."

##IX. Milun

- __1-8__: One could simply look at the variety of _prologues_ to figure out some of Marie's main concerns. Here the clear speech praised in the third line ("si rainablement") and the idea that _lais_ are __found__ - that her _song_ is the song of __why__ and __how__ the _song itself_ was made - "pur quei e coment fu trovez | li lais ki issi est numez." A lai is an etiology for its own existence.

- __9-18__: The context is clearly __insular__: many toponyms from the North.

- __22__: Given the prominence of the _protagonist's_ first name (in the first line of the story itself) and the absence of this character's name, emphasized here ("mes heo ne sai numer sun num"), we can say that _names matter_.

- __25__: Indeed, the dame falls in love with Milun when "ele ot oi Milun nomer."

- __31-32__: Love is given in these stories - like a _concrete gift_ that one deliberately decides to offer to somebody else - "Volentier otriat l'amur."

- __48__: A ring is given together with the __love__, as a token between two strangers.

- __49-54__: The customary garden; this story is seemingly more realistic than the rest, especially given this _sudden pregnancy_: "tant i vin Milun, tant l'ama."

- __63-64__: "Ceo fu custume as anciens | issi teneient en cel tens." A surprising annotation - _temporal distance_. Perhaps a way of _moderating_ the potential __cruelty__ of the story? The woman discovers that she is pregnant, and she fears that she will be either _killed_ or _deported_. __Idealism__ - __realism__ - __cruelty__. Love is now terrifying.

- __67-86__: The woman's plan of sending her newborn to her sister relies on __writing__ and __tokens__.

- __107-110__: The hyberbole of __stopping__ seven times a day emphasizes the value of the baby.

- __129__: "E suvent regrette Milun" - the lady regrets having loved. Love is now _execrated_.

- __133-148__: This monologue is another briliant example of Marie's attention to women's conditions: the lady has been betrayed and mistreated - and she'd rather die.

- __163-164__: A __swan__ is now the _carrier of love messages_. Instead of changing the woman's condition, this terrible main character decides to exploit it.

- __172-202__: The entrance of the __bird__ in the enclosed space of the _castle_ is similar to the animals seen in _Laustic_ and in _Yonec_. But here it is more realistic.

- __217-219__: A vivid sequence of simple _verbs_ - again: "Le col li manie e le chief | deduz la plume sent le brief | li sancs li remut e fremi."

- __229__: The editor of this edition decides to add __inverted__ commas to what could be considered as _indirect discourse_. To communicate with Milun, the woman has to _train the swan_, by feeding it or not.

- __252-260__: The animal's suffering (__fasting__) is again equal to its _semantic_ functions; this story is truly obsessed with __naming__ and _writing_, in any case.

- __277-288__: The system has been established: the bird's _fasting_ allows for the lovers' communicating.

- __309-308__: The
