19-#Marie de France - Lais

##Introduction

- Marie de France: we only know her __name__ and that she wrote three works: the _Lais_, the _Fables_, the _Espurgatoire_.

- The _Lais_ are translated from the Anglosaxon "pseudo-Alfred".

- Marie was probably working at the court of Henry II - hence her __foreign__ name; Henry II becomes king of __England__ and __France__ in 1154.

	- Henry II was considered as a restless king, constantly on the __move__; he would never cease travelling from the continent to the island, and from the island to the continent.

- The main __literary__ preoccupation of MdF seems to be the her conciliation of __sacred__ and __profane__ matter.

- THe __context__ of her writing was the __irresistible__ spread of the __Arthurian matter__; similarly, her work is in contrast with the __classical__ content and inspiration of some _Romans_ (_Eneas_, _Thebes_). Marie is closer to the _former_ (Chretien's knights).

- __Lai__ (from the __Celtic/Irish__ _Laid_) was originally a __song__.

- Written between 1160 and 1170.

- First French work by a __woman author__; first French work of _short fiction_.

##Prologue

- __1__: speaking immediately becomes writing, and writing is __amplified__, magnified, in a __bookish__ world of _authors_, critics, and glosses. MdF seems well aware of the context of __literary production__ and __literary interpretation__ to which / on which her works depends.

- __pr. 24-27__: __ethical concerns__: writing, reading and learning make you a _more virtuous_ person. A better person. And they prevent _evil_ and _grief_.

- __pr. 29-30__: "d'aukune bone estoire faire | et de latin en romanz traire" - __make__ stories (and) translate them from _Latin_ into _Romance_.

- __pr. 33-34__: the __Lais__ as a genre are what make her effort special.

- __pr. 35-36__: the purpose of __composing__ (and translating) is twofold: they allow for a __memory__ of the story itself, and form a __memory__ of its _author_.

- __Pr. 41-42__: "Rimé en ai e fait ditié | Soventes fiez en ai veillié!"

- __pr. 43__: a dedication to the good king - Henry II.

##Guigemar

- __Gu. 1-2__: A strong attention to the __making__ of a _story_ - the _quality of form_.

- __Gu. 8-9__: In a way, Marie is constantly becoming a __character__ of her own world - an actor comparable to the protagonists of her stories.

- __Gu. 13-14__: __Envie__ and the evil dog - "malvais chien, coart, falus"

- __Gu. 19-23__: Origin of the __Lais__ in __Bretagne__. They are said to be _true_, and they have been transmitted orally. But there are also written documents about them. The continuity between _written_ and _spoken_ is certainly remarkable.

- __Gu. 25__: the setting of the story is said to be the __Bretagne__ la Menur.

- __Gu. 27-33__: from the _Land_ to its _Lord_, from the _lord_ to its _vassal_ (Knight).

- __Gu. 37__: Guigemar is "le dancel" - the noble boy.

- __Gu. 52-54__: the synctactic and rhetorical structure of the verse follows a __binary__ pattern; __endiadis__ seems to be the leading device.

- __Gu. 61-68__: __Nature__ punishes the _Lord_, and the punishment is an impossibility to love (inability? unavailability?). "Il n'aveit de ceo talent." The man is perfect, but he cannot be until he enters the society of __monogamous, heterosexual love__. Guigemar keeps his intention to love a __secret__: "Nuls se pout aperceiver ke il volsit amur aveir." His __will__ is well determined, the problem is __nature__ (desire? body?)

- __Gu. 91__: appearance of a wonderful beast - a white doe; a female deer with stags? a female deer with antlers?

- __Gu. 94__: here is probably the __crucial magical episode__ of the story.

	- It should be noted how quick paced the narrative form is. THere is a lively usage of __tenses__ - historical (or vivid) present, past __perfect__ that simply jumps when juxtaposed with the imperfect. The lesson is Latin - but Marie is simply concerned with briliant, expressive story telling. THe only visible recurrent trope is __endiadis__. The line coincides with the __syntax__ constantly. The meter is __octosyllabic couplet__.

- __Gu. 100-104__: __Direct discourse__ is another surprising device for __vividness__. Here the hurt doe curses Gui. and his wound - he strangely seems to __have deserved__ the _curse_.

- __Gu. 152__: Description of a wonderful object - the __ship__. The following lines are devoted to the __ekphrasis__ of this exotic piece of art - a __foreign__ object in a dock that is not supposed to host __foreigners__. "En la cuntree nel pais | N'out unkes mes oi parler | ke neufs peust ariver."

- __Gu. 140__: the __wound__ has a strong influence on the __character__, on the __narrator__, and on the __reader__.

- __Gu. 171__: the __ekphrasis__ of the precious ship becomes an __ekphrasis__ of a beautiful bed. _Eros_ is again connected to a _foreign seduction_ - and perhaps a foreign _threat_.

- __Gu. 188__: the bed becomes the _vessel_ - and again the emphasis on the __wound__ should be emphasized - "Repose sei, sa plaie doelt" (189)

	- The __wound__ is at the same time the _obscure seduction_ of _sex_ and the inevitable _threat_ of _death_.

- __Gu. 199__: the __wound__ is also the _aventure_ - "Sufrir li estuet l'aventure."

- __Gu. 204__: Again, the rhetorical greatness of Marie's style is all devoted to storytelling. Here we have a __prolexis__ that becomes a whole narrative in the __future tense__: "ainz le vespre ariverat..."

- __Gu. 214__: the presence of __Nature__ as an _inevitable force_ - or, better, as the condition which shapes those _traits of personality_ - of _individuality_ - of _character_ - that cannot be bent or __transformed by will or reason__. "Nature" is what you _cannot help but be_ - the __inevitable side of identity__. "Kar ceo purporte la Nature | Ke tust li vieil seient gelus."

- __Gu. 220__: here we have a _description of the Queen's prison_. A beautiful prison - again a combination of __exotic__ and __precious__. _Ekphrasis_. Enclosed chambers are always literary metaphors - they stand for a __book__, for a genre, for a __tradition__. Here the _chamber_ was painted by _Venus_, and it has episodes from the _Ars Amandi_ - le _Livre Ovide_ (239) - No, better still; the walls of the chamber depict _Venus_ as she is throwing Ovid's book [on sexual restraint] into the __fire__.

- __Gu. 240__: "En un fu ardant le get tout | e tuz iceus escumen gout | ki jamais al livre livreient" - __buring__ of the teaching of __restraint__.

- __Gu. 257__: A grotesque detail" the __keeper__ of the prison's keys is an _evirated priest_: "le plus bas membres out perduz | autrement ne fust pas creuz."

- __Gu. 261__: Amazing transition - from the youth and the ship to the lady in the garden. __Change in perspective__. The two girls see the ship - now _Guigemar_ is the __foreigner__ - the exotic presence - the _stranger_.

- __Gu. 277__: the detail of the __lady__ taking of her _mantel_. The story easily becomes a long narrative of _mutual seduction_: "sun mantel oste la pulcele | entre en la neif, ki mut fu bele." A series of elaborate metaphors for a hymeneus - for __defloration__ - discovery of _sex_ - and _death_.

- __Gu. 282__: And indeed - "pale le vit, mort le quira": Guigemare __seems dead__.

- __Gu. 283-85__: Notice the interaction between the queen and her __handsmaid__ - typical of subsequent developments of the genre as well (up to Shakespeare).

- __Gu. 348__: the Queen hopes that the old man will __burn__. The old man could also stand for the __castrating ingerence__ of the __church__ in sexual policy.

- __Gu. 378__: Guigemar is now hidden in the secret chamber that doubles as a __prison__ - he sleeps in the _handsmaid's bed_.

- __Gu. 379__: the __analogy__ between the _physical wound_ and the _seduction_ is here reiterated - "mes l'amur l'ot feru al vif". __Tender__ open wound. Later - "De sa plaie nul mal se sent | Mut suspire anguisement" (383-384)

- __Gu. 392__: the __love is mutual__; reciprocity of seduction - different __metaphors__: the _piercing_ (for Guig.), the _fire_ (for the Queen).

- __Gu. 399__: Here we have a wonderful __monologue__, expressing Guigemar's inner doubts. This simple monologue (7 lines) is the heart of the lai - __its exact center__.

- __Gu. 409-410__: __Endurance__ seems to be the key factor here - what Gu. realizes is that __avanture__ is simply something that one has to __endure__ - grief that is inevitable, and that should be accepeted as such soon. "E dit que suffrir li estoet | Kar issi fait ki mes ne poet" - Suffering suits those who cannot do better. There seems to be a Boethian undertone here. _Changing fortune and acceptance_.

- __Gu. 430__: Here we have _Amur_ as an agent of __grief__; it affects both the queen and Guigemar. The chief problem of this section is __knowledge__. THe handsmaid is the only character who can understand the __hidden feelings of love__ by observing their _outward manifestations_ (signs - symptoms).

- __Gu. 451-453__: A demonstration of the potential __boethian__ reading, ad of MdF's wonderful simplicity - "ceste amur sereit covenable | si vus amdui feussez estable: | vus estes bels e ele est bele." The real issue is __stability__ - and _form_ (appearance, beatuty) corresponds to _content_ (feeling, virtue).

- __Gu. 467__: again __fine__ psychological detail and __masterful__ use of _interior voices_; monologues and indirect discourse. "Saveir voleit quei cil feseit | si il veillout u il dormeit | pur ki amur sis quors ne fine." Simplicity of style - few powerful elements, devotion to __narrative__.

- __Gu. 478__: the _foreigner_'s fear: "pur ceo qu'il ert d'estrange terre | aveit pour, s'il li mustrast | qu'el l'enhaist e esloinast"

- __Gu. 483__: a few lines later, the __overarching__ system of _metaphors_ is made __explicit__: "Amur est plaie dedenz cors | E si ne pient nient dehors | Ceo est un mal ki lunges tient, | Pur ceo que de Nature vient." Nature had forbidden love - had precluded Guigemar from it - but now Nature - again - is binding him to love. The following lines contain some __instructions__ about its correct regulation - loyalty and value.

- __Gu. 501__: Guigemar reveals his feelings to the Queen; the narrative becomes __dialogue__.

- __Gu. 533__: Marie alludes to _sexual intercourse_ with special tact: "bien sur convience del surplus | de ceo que li autre cest en us"

- __Gu. 538__: Here we find an explicit __Boethian referent__: the wheel of Fortune, substituting _nature_ and _Amur_ - "Mes Fortune, ki ne s'oblie | Sa roe turne en poi d'inre | l'un met desuz, l'autre desure."

- __Gu. 546__: strange sense of __omen__ in the queen's words. __Future tense__.

- __Gu. 564__: Another conventional __motive__ of the __romance__ (and the _fabliaux_?): the _knotted shirt_ and the love pawn; "le pleit fait en teu mesure, | nule femme nel deffereit | si force u cutel ni meteit."

- __Gu. 577__: The two lovers are discovered __on the same day__: "ce jur furent aparceu." Great detail.

- __Gu. 586__: Marie seems to feel sympaty for the _Lord of the Castle_ as well - "Quant li sires l'ad entendu | Unques mes tant dolenz ne fu!"

- __Gu. 595__: There is a __hint of realism__ - the realism of _fabliaux_ - domestic, and, in a way, trivializing - in the weapon that Guigemar snatches to protect himself from the soldiers - "une grosse perche de sap | u suleient pendre li drap | pris en ses mains e sis atent." There is something __ridicolous__ in this _concrete detail_.

- __Gu. 620__: Again - Marie's grace is in sythesis and colour - a _quick, vivid narrator_. "La barge trovent, enz l'ent mis | od lui s'ent vet en sun pais."

- __Gu. 624__: the dame (queen?) prays God; it's the first __explicit__ reference to it in the narrative - "et prie Deu omnipotent | qu'il li dunait hastive mort" - actually, it is Guigemar who prais, on a ship that seems _allegorical_.

- __Gu. 655__: the playful, sensual implications of the _knotted shirt_ are perhaps worthy of more attention. Are there sensual references here?

- __Gu. 673__: here we have a mysterious, almost supernatural, instance of __aventure__ - without any specific human intervention, the door to the lady's prison (a _degraded_ version of the original) has disappeared. "Ne treve cleif ne sereure | fors s'en eissi; par aventure..."

- __Gu. 689__: Here we have a specific reference to a __land__ and to a _ruler_: Bretaigne and Meriadu. Again the point of view shifts, and we perceive the ship approaching the _foreign shores_ from the perspective of its inhabitant.

- __Gu. 737-738__: Here we have an apparent __attempted rape__ - the breaking of the laces is accomplished, but not that of the _belt_.

- __Gu. 746__: __war__ is a _persistent context_, an unchangeable element of the _background_.

- __Gu. 748__: Guigemar is one of Meriaduc's peers and friends. They belong to the same _social world_ - and they are, perhaps, __mirroring figures__ (the only named ones).

- __Gu. 773__: the two lovers _meet again_. Another touching __monologue__ for Guigemar. THere's some casual sexism as well: "femmes se resemblent asez."

- __Gu. 789__: Again, the two lovers are contrasted by a jealous third presence. __Meriadus__ and the queen seem to be a functionally established __couple__ by now. Again, too, Marie feels sympathy for the jealous man: "dolenz en fu, il ne pot plus."

- __Gu. 822__: Like the unfortunate episode that has separated them, the __fortunate__ one that brings them back together is __aventure__ - "queil aventure."

- __Gu. 848-850__: jealousy is the trigger of violence - and this violence is assimilated to - compared to - __war__. Here the romance acquires a __political__ dimension. It bears historical resemblance to the present.

- __Gu. 859__: The __decisive element__ of the ending is the loyalty due by Guigemar's vassals to their land; the romance - and its meditations on fortune - is resolved through history, diplomacy, and politics.

- __Gu. 873__: The conclusion is striking: Guigemar decides to side with Meriadu's enemy, and he sieges Meriadu's castle with his army in order to slay the lord and snatch away the nameless queen. This murder could even resemble an act of __revenge__ and betrayal. THe rythm of the section is also especially frantic, and the ending seems abrupt - leaving the two lovers almost on the side.

##Equitan

- __Eq. 1-2__: two elements are here _reiterated_: the __nobility of the bretons__ and the __mnemonic and celebratory function__ of their lais, records of _aventures_.

- __Eq. 16-20__: The __narrative__ premise of the story combines the devotion to the ideal of _chivalrie_ with the __danger__ of _unrestrained love_. The two are __not__ mutually exclusive.

- __Eq. 21-28__: The theme of __feudal__ loyalty returns here; Equitan spends his time _abroad_, and leaves a "senseschal" behind at every time; is this a reference to __Henry II__?

- __Eq. 29-41__: Again the themes of love and __misogyny__ (love is always extramarital) become mixed with those of __loyalty__ to the lord. _Forbidden love_.

- __Eq. 64__: Again the accurate symptomatology of love; again the __careful, masterful__ use of _indirect discourse_ and _monologue_. It is the mode of __ethical doubt__.

- __Eq. 71__: and this is the _Vergilian_ conflict between erotic satisfaction (or even happiness) and devotion to the __political body__ - _duty_ and _selfishness_.

- __Eq. 87-88__: Here are two of the best lines so far: "suls ne la peot pas li tenir! | certes, jeo voil a li parir!" Equitan projects his will onto the other characters.

- __Eq. 114-116__: Here the alternative to __love__ - satisfied _love_ - is stressed - it is __death__ - emphasized bu the __repetition__ of _meort_/_mort_ and the rhyme with _confort_.

- __Eq. 137__: A wonderful twist - the __prolexis__ had anticipated a _misogynystic content_, where only the woman would have been to blame - but the speech that she she uses to dissuade the king is _perfectly rational_, and very convincing. The king is to blame; the lady is the voice of __rationality__ and __virtue__.

- __Eq. 150__: dialogue and __debate__ seems as well to be another frequent mode for the _Lais_. Here we have one about _loving above (or below) one's condition_.

- __Eq. 184__: the pace here becomes - again - so quick as to seem __abrupt__.

- __Eq. 195-196__: Here the alternation between the various motives is clearly exposed; the vassal holds the __political__ role, while the king keeps the __private__ (and his excuse his __deliberately physiological__ - he has his body drained); the vassal occupies the space of __history__, the king that of __romance__ (duty, eros).

- __Eq. 232-234__: Now the __clandestine__ couple is planning the __murder__ of the _diligent seneschalc_, the only character truly concerned with _history and politics_; it is a sort of __perverse regicide__ - and the man seems the single righteous character.

- __Eq. 244-246__: Here we have an interesting reference to the _two men_ - their bodies - bathing.

-  __Eq. 253__: the __method__ chosen is especially __cruel__: a burning bath, to have him "escadeuz" e "malmis."

- __Eq. 296-299__: Equitan's death is __abrupt__, violent - and somewhat _surprising_. There is something __ridiculous__ in his forgetfulness and in his __shame__. Similarly violent is the way in which the vassal pushes his wife into the tub: there is not much __nobility in these Bretons__: no character is saved - none is redeemable (positive).

- __Eq. 308__: Marie invites us to draw a __moral__ - reisun - from the exemplary tale - it is a general __admonition__ against violence: "tels purcace le mal d'autrui | dunt tuz i mals revert sur lui." At the end of the story, the woman is perhaps the true victim: reasonable, virtuous, and forced to __love__ and __suffer__.
