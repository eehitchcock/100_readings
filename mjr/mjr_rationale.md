##Rationale - General

My primary intention while preparing this list has been to gain a more comprehensive understanding of what we currently regard as the Middle English canon. In order to consider the titles that constitute this canon in their original literary context, with a special focus on the changes occurring during the thirteenth and fourteenth century, I have have ordered them chronologically, emphasizing, when possible, the ways that they paralleled or even influenced each other. Moreover, I have attempted to include those titles that, in my opinion, I will be most likely to teach in the future. In shaping this canonical list, therefore, I have chosen works that are still frequently read and studied, either because they are widely regarded as influential examples in the period, or because they are still appreciated as outstanding pieces of literature today. Following this principle, I have included both texts that we ascribe to anonymous or disputed writers, like _Sir Orfeo_, _The Cloud of Unknowing_, _Pearl_ and _Sir Gawain_, and those whose authors we recognize as prominently identifiable literary figures, like Julian of Norwich or Geoffrey Chaucer. However, because this is meant to be an inclusive but not an exhaustive list, I have also decided to frame it around two broad literary categories that are often associated with the definition and the study of medieval literature in Middle English: the genre of "romance" and the concept of "vision." Because the combination of these two terms, generally but not exclusively corresponding to the contrast between secular and religious writing, covers an extensive, malleable, and often overlapping body of forms and contents, this decision has prompted me to organize this canon as a tentative set of questions.

##Rationale - Romance

In the case of the "romance" section of the list, these questions emerge even before the inception of Middle English literature. In her chapter on the insular histoy of romance, Rosalind Field explains how this adaptable genre first developed in England after the Norman conquest, as a form of programmatic assimilation of foreign sources, mostly for entertainment, and in order to emulate the preexisting Anglo-Saxon tradition of vernacular writing. The emergence of romance presupposed the participation of bilingual or even trilingual writers, who adapted and translated, mostly from Latin and French, narratives of different kinds from the continent. As secular literature expanded during the twelfth and the thirteenth century, in many cases multiple insular translations of the same story have survived. To assess some of the potential differences and similarities between some of these adaptations, in my list I have included both the Anglo-Norman and the Middle English versions of romances like _Amis and Amiloun_ and _King Horn_. Besides the connotations of their double background, linguistic and possibly social, these two works exemplify the scope of contents and forms encompassed by the genre. Composed in octosyllabic couplets first (Anglo-Norman), and in tail-rhyme stanzas later (Middle English), _Amis and Amiloun_ tells a story of friendship, sin, and miraculous redemption, set in Northern Italy; on the other hand, _King Horn_ focuses on a distinctly British warrior and ruler, whose epic battles, fought against imaginary pagan invaders, are first recounted in an unusual rhyming _laisse_ (Anglo-Norman), reminiscent of the Old French chansons de geste, and then rendered in short, heavily stressed couplets (Middle English). For this list I have therefore chosen texts that could represent the several facets of this stylistic and thematic heterogeneity, including explorations of courtly love (Thomas' _Tristran_ and the Middle English _Sir Tristrem_), fictions of exotic journeys and magical artifacts (_Floris and Blancheflour_), exemplary accounts of regal virtue, either political (_Havelok the Dane_) or spiritual (_Stanzaic Guy of Warwick_), and a late, alliterative retelling of Arthurian matter (_The Alliterative Morte Arthure_). I have also selected works that might have influenced, or perhaps have been influenced by, the diverse manifestations of this inclusive genre, such as the _Lais_ of Marie de France, Chaucer's _Troilus and Criseyde_, and Lydgate's _Troy Book_. Finally, the list also contains those fragments from Chaucer's _The Canterbury Tales_ where we find adaptations or imitations of romance (_The Knight's Tale_, _The Wife of Bath's Tale_, _The Merchant's Tale_, _The Squire's Tale_, and _Sir Thopas_), a testament to the simultaneous endurance and elusivity of the genre.



 As a tentative device to delimit, structure, and review this broad range of texts, in a comprehensive though not exhaustive way, I have organized the collection around two of the major literary categories that usually shape our perception of the period. On the one hand, I have proposed to follow the development of the so-called "dream visions," texts generally characterized by the presence of a dreamer-narrator, and encompassing visionary works of theological contemplation and intellectual debate; on the other, I have tried to define the boundaries of the broad and malleable genre of "romance," a generative repository of narrative tropes and themes, often identifiable  occasionally identified with any sort of vernacular fiction in verse. The porousness of this double classification has allowed me to include several of the most commonly taught texts from the period, embracing both anonymous works (like _Sir Orfeo_, _The York Corpus Christi Cycle_, _Pearl_, _Sir Gawain and the Green Knight_), and the essential writings by the first generations of recognized Middle English authors (Chaucer, Langland, Gower, Hoccleve). Moreover, the decision to arrange this diverse collection of titles around an apparently constraining dichotomy has prompted me to recognize crucial differences and continuities in the deployment and adaptation of a specific set of forms, contents, and motives.
