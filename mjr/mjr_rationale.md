##Rationale - General

My primary intention while preparing this list has been to gain a more insightful understanding of what we currently regard as the Middle English canon. In order to consider the titles that constitute this canon in their original literary context, with a special focus on the changes occurring during the thirteenth and fourteenth century, I have have ordered them chronologically, emphasizing, when possible, the ways that they paralleled or even influenced each other. Moreover, I have strived to include those titles that, in my opinion, I will be most likely to teach in the future. In shaping this canonical list, therefore, I have chosen works that are still frequently read and studied today, either because they are widely regarded as influential examples from their period, or because they are still appreciated as outstanding pieces of literature. Following this principle, I have included both texts that we ascribe to anonymous or disputed writers, like _Sir Orfeo_, _The Cloud of Unknowing_, _Pearl_ and _Sir Gawain_, and those whose authors we recognize as prominently identifiable literary figures, like Julian of Norwich or Geoffrey Chaucer. However, because this is meant to be an inclusive but not quite an exhaustive list, I have also decided to frame it around two broad literary categories that are often associated with the definition and the study of medieval and Middle English literature: the genre of "romance" and the concept of "vision." Because the combination of these two terms, generally but not exclusively corresponding to the contrast between secular and religious writing, covers an extensive, malleable, and often overlapping body of forms and contents, this decision has prompted me to organize this canon as a tentative set of questions, concerning the purposes and limitations of this taxonomy, rather than as a rigid imposition on its structure.

##Rationale - Romance

In the case of the "romance" section of the list, these questions begin with the geographical and linguistic boundaries of the classification. These become especially problematic when we consider its Middle English inception during the thirteenth century. In her chapter on _Romance in England_, Rosalind Field explains how this adaptable genre developed as a form of programmatic assimilation of foreign sources, mostly for entertainment. This process began after the Norman Conquest, as an attempt to emulate the preexisting Anglo-Saxon tradition of vernacular writing, considered a worthy model. The emergence of romance in Britain during the twelfth and thirteenth centuries presupposed the participation of bilingual or even trilingual writers, who adapted and translated, mostly from Latin and French, several of these narratives from the continent. In many cases multiple insular translations of the same story have survived. To assess some of the potential differences and similarities between some of these adaptations, in my list I have included both the Anglo-Norman and the Middle English versions of _Amis and Amiloun_ and _King Horn_. Besides the connotations of their double background, linguistic and possibly social, these two works exemplify the scope of contents and forms encompassed by the genre. Composed in octosyllabic couplets first, and in tail-rhyme stanzas later, _Amis and Amiloun_ tells a story of friendship, sin, and miraculous redemption, set in Northern Italy; on the other hand, _King Horn_ focuses on an insular warrior and ruler, who defends his land against imaginary pagan invaders and whose epic battles, in the Anglo-Norman text, are recounted in an unusual rhyming _laisse_, reminiscent of the Old French chansons de geste. 

 I have thus embraced the  this taxonomy as a productive set of questions, embracing the problematic classification of works like _The Canterbury Tales_, here split between the two sections, as an opportunity for thought.

I have therefore arranged this list chronologically, and I have strived to include those texts that, I sense, I will be most likely to teach in the future. In shaping this canonical collection I have chosen both anonymous or disputed works that are still widely read and ackowledged as influential or outstanding, like _Sir Orfeo_, _The Cloud of Unknowing_, _Pearl_ and _Sir Gawain_,

This list is intended to help me gain a better comprehension of the Middle English canon during the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. 

 As a tentative device to delimit, structure, and review this broad range of texts, in a comprehensive though not exhaustive way, I have organized the collection around two of the major literary categories that usually shape our perception of the period. On the one hand, I have proposed to follow the development of the so-called "dream visions," texts generally characterized by the presence of a dreamer-narrator, and encompassing visionary works of theological contemplation and intellectual debate; on the other, I have tried to define the boundaries of the broad and malleable genre of "romance," a generative repository of narrative tropes and themes, often identifiable  occasionally identified with any sort of vernacular fiction in verse. The porousness of this double classification has allowed me to include several of the most commonly taught texts from the period, embracing both anonymous works (like _Sir Orfeo_, _The York Corpus Christi Cycle_, _Pearl_, _Sir Gawain and the Green Knight_), and the essential writings by the first generations of recognized Middle English authors (Chaucer, Langland, Gower, Hoccleve). Moreover, the decision to arrange this diverse collection of titles around an apparently constraining dichotomy has prompted me to recognize crucial differences and continuities in the deployment and adaptation of a specific set of forms, contents, and motives.
