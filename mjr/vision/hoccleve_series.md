#Hoccleve - The Series

##Introduction

- the premise is that the collection was devised by the author as a coherent whole: the complaint; the dialog; the tale of jereslaus' wife; how to learn to die; and tale of jonathas. these are preserved in a ms that was, allegedly, an autograph.

- the regement of princes was concluded in 1411-1412.

- like chaucer, hoccleve was a clerk. he worked at the privy seal office (bureaucrat).

- according to furnivall, he had a dissolute youth, followed by a somber life as a "poor married man."

- the years that lead to the series are 5 years of alleged __madness__ - 1417 - 1422. he died twenty-eight years later, in 1450.

- the complaint juxtaposes parts in ryme royale with parts in prose; it is a prosimetrum.

##The Complaint

35. the opening contrast is between the cyclical decay of nature and the unexpectedness of human fortune, constantly shifting. the focus moves from the leaves outside to the image of the poet in his bed, uncapable of sleeping. he decides to sing __poems as a remedy__ to anxiety.

	- there is the sense of an __overflowing__ abundance of sorrow about time and change. [_poetry is a remedy, a medicine; poetry is the valve that releases the anxiety of sickness - the sickness of anxiety. poetry is needed. the comfort is poetry is needed._]

140. the description of the sickness is the loss of __fame and fortune__; two ideas are particularly upsetting - the fact that hoccleve lost his friends - he is now socially digraced - and the fact that this might happen again at any time - it is something __ordered by god__, like the gifts of __providence__ that we perceive as __fate__. boethian matrix. [_like usk, hoccleve is adapting his biography to the boethian model; the obscure forces of history have now become forces of the self, the unpredictability of our bodies and minds._]

224. here we find the episode of the __mirror__ - the fear of identifying something __foreign__ within a familiar context.

	- there is a sustained contrast between __appearances__ and __interiority__. hoccleve controls his outward appearance, but at the same time he doesn't want people to judge him from that. he wants them to know that he __has changed__; he is different from his __reputation__. [_the contrast between appearance and interiority can be referred to the wider problem of signifier and signified; hoccleve is a broken signifier - he is trying to understand how his body is working as a readable sign for others to perceive and evaluate._]

308. the identification between __mental illness__ and the fall of __fortune__ is here made explicit. the section is an authentic __complaint__ against rumors and unpredictability. [_rumors are the voices of others that hoccleve collects, reproduces, and evokes; rumors are the interpretations that others apply to hoccleve as a signifier - interpretations that may or may not correspond to the actual signified._]

413. in the conclusion, the poet reads and translates into the english __ryme royale__ a __consolation book__ by [_someone?_], where he speaks with __reason__. the state of despair is the one shared by the poet - the poet in fact becomes the __voice__ of the book, and receives the __advice__ of reason for himself. [_the poet is absorbed by the book; and the poem itself absorbs the book as one of its interlocutors; the dialogue becomes the dialogue of the book._]like in usk, the dream vision has become a purely __literary experience__. the conclusion is a prayer where god is thanked - acccepted.

	- the consolation works; hoccleve understands and embraces the __fluctuations of fame__. [_that is what we mean by "god being accepted"; fate is accepted as providence - the consolation of reason marks the conciliation between the poet and god._]

##The dialog

91. the text is inseparable from the previous one; it is its immediate __expansion__ and __reception__; the poem finds a public, and the poet an interlocutor (no longer literary or phantasmagoric [_we might assume_]), a __friend___ [_or the allegorical embodiment of a friend? one of langland's companions in the long pilgrimage of the lost soul_]. the problem is that of __reception__; how will the audience react to __hoccleve's honesty__? what begins is a __monologue__ where he defends his work.

198. the first defense is a long comparison with the problem of counterfeit money - it is the social and economic counterpart to the falsehood now spread about hoccleve. [_falsity is a material problem; falsity is a social problem that has concrete consequences; the circulation of false ideas affects the material premises of our everyday existence._]

290. hoccleve presents his projects to his friend; he will __translate__ and adapt the "lerne to dye," because it may be useful to contemprary and future generations. his speech indeed starts to __integrate__ the motives of memento mori and ubi sunt [_as for the consolation, he is rapidly absorbed by the book that he is discussing, as does the poem itself_] - he will translate the text because he is close to death, and he knows that the world is transient. the mental trajectory remains the same: individual experience [_hoccleve's personal needs and intellectual curiosity_], public reception [_amicus' suggestions, which stand for the literary expectations of the public_], reading [_other sources_].

419. the friend objects that hoccleve might not be ready for this task; hoccleve replies that his lack of faith is the sign of a faulty friendship - he should trust him. the friend explains that his advice is instead that of a trusty friend. the dialog presents a __true contrast__; it is not the simple __maieutic pedagogy__ found in [_canonical_] __visionary texts__ [_, where an experienced and unquestionable instructor educates an ignorant interlocutor_]. the friend believes that reading and writing might be the cause of the __illness__; a personified opponent [_that is, the personification of the ideas that oppose hoccleve's intention; perhaps of hoccleve's own doubts about himself_].

	- it has, in fact, more in common with the interlocutors of __langland__ - he might be right [_he is a reasonable opponent, and the reader perceives his argument as potentially persuasive_].

511. the friend admits that he was __testing hoccleve's sanity__; and hoccleve, who has acknowledged that the friend is __reasonable__, has passed the test - he has proved his capacity to engage in an intellectual conversation. he will work, but he won't stress himself. [_the interaction with the friend is therefore necessary; the conclusion mediates between their positions, and the two opponents are eventually persuaded that their reciprocal positions are acceptable._]

	- the passage reminds us of the __trial tradition__, from [the] york [cycle], to langland, to parliaments [in chaucer].

619. another __literary anticipation__, after the translation from __ltd__; hoccleve must write something that will please __his mentor__. what follows is a long praise of his virtue [_encomiastic_].

714. the friend advises hoccleve to write a book in __praise and defense__ of women, as an __act of contrition__ for his previous scolding and ignoring women. writing as the step towards __absolution__ and __redemption__. the friend cites the wife of bath as a literary authority. writing is again a public act, a __mediation__.

780. the final section concerns hoccleve's relationship with women, including his wife. hoccleve explains that he has always been blamed for the contents of the _cupid_ - but there he was just a translator; his task was that of reporting the original author's words [_or thoughts_] precisely. the ethical responsabilities of literature. [_hoccleve is a very self-aware writer._]

826. the conclusion is a dedication of the following tale to the women who will read or hear the collection of poems. hoccleve is offering his work as an __apology__. [_writing as an act._]

##The emperor jereslaus' wife

63. the opening is that of a __romance__. the emperor is wedded with a beautiful and virtuous woman; he decides to leave for the holy land, and makes her the "lady" of the empire.

	- the decision comes to him [_the emperor_] as he is laying in his bed. [_like hoccleve at the beginning of the series; what do we do of this correspondence?_]

	- hoccleve, like chaucer, keeps acknowledging his sources [_here he carefully distinguishes his invention from what he finds in the original that he is translating from_]. his writing is a __constant dialog__ with an __open book__.

168. the emperor's evil brother, left behind as the stweard, oppresses his land and tries to seduce the wife - in vain. the wife manages to have him imprisoned, thanks to the mediation of the emperor's council; but she frees him before the king arrives, moved by pity for him.

	- the steward __performs__ contrition and virtue to be saved [_fakes would be a more appropriate word_]; the contrast between __appearance__ and __truth__ is the same seen in the complaint and dialog. hoccleve like the villain. [_the contrast between a deceiving signifier and a surprising signified remains therefore the same._]

266. the scene of __violence__. outside a wood, the lady is threatened by the stweard, who will have his way with her or hang her from a tree. she refuses to have sex with him, and he strips her naked and hangs her. it is a __brutal and dark twist__, and it is solely based on her __compassion__ for him. at the core of this section we find a dialogue about this option [_this choice_]; to sleep with him or to risk death. _rape is not an option._ [_where is rape in these stories? why is it always only suggested - perhaps with the sole exception of the wife of bath?_]

	- like a heroine in a hagiography, the wife chooses to endure the chance of death. [_the risk of death is preferred to the certainty of defilement._]

378. the narrative follows the perspective of the wife; she is found by an earl and chosen as a tutor for his daughter. but even in this new court an evil steward falls in love with her and decides to frame her for murder - to avenge her rejection [_that is, this steward too tries to seduce the woman and fails; having been refused, he avenges himself by framing her for murder_]. the context is similar to that of the _man of law's tale_, only darker and more violent; the stweard kills the earl's daughter (and this is too, like in that case, a __foreign new land__). the contrast is again that between __appearances and truth__ [_signifier and its interpretation_].

476. exiled from the earl's court, the empress finds a thief condemned to hang from the gallows on a street [_or road_]. she buys the thief as her servant [_thus rescuing him from death_]; he helps her find an accommodation in the nearest town, where she quickly gains a widespread reputation as a beautiful exotic woman. the situation is similar to that in which the earl has found her - hanging and humiliated [_similar signifiers, different signifieds_]. the empress again decides to __mistrust__ appearances, and to trust the hanging man. invincible pity for all.

581. the poet makes an explicit reference to the virtue of "constance," adding another connection to chaucer's tale. he praises the empress' steadfastness - ethical stability (unchangeable virtue, unlike the constant changeability of __fortune and fame__). the thief-servant makes a deal with a merchant to let him kidnap the woman and bring her away - but only when the wind is favorable. the reference is again to the unpredictable and constantly shifting forces of __history and fate__ [_the boethian reading is the one that is most obviously drawn from chaucer; it is the least surprising one_].

679. on the ship, as the merchant again threatens her to have sex with her [_threatens to kill her in order to have sex with her_], she obtains a miraculous storm through her prayer, which sends her to a new shore. an act of __providence__.

777. __providence__ has also avenged the empress by sending illnesses to her attackers [__NB__: _the readability of providence is the readability of the signifier of time; it is our ability to perceive god in history - at times we are able to read god in history, to allign the broken signifiers of time with the eternal single meaning of divinity - when this happens, we are accessing the high theological truths contemplated by the inaccessible spheres - through visions - through dreams - when we are able to allign the signified and the signifier, we are doing what the angels do in the primum mobile - we are reading god, we are interpreting god - interpretation is the machine that brings us closer to god - interpretation is time and eternity occupying the same space in the chain of meaning, of the meaning making machine. interpretation is theology, but interpretation is also ethical and even ontological ascension. the angels are readers; the angels are working with signifiers and signifieds, as we are. this is a moment when providence and fate suddenly coincide - when fate has become readable as providence; it is, therefore, a moment when we can access god._] - leprosy to one steward, palsy to the other. the hand of god is restoring order (through illness, a relevant issue for hoccleve); fate becomes providence (same for the thief-servant and the merchant - the latter in a frenzy). is hoccleve implying that his own sickness was motivated by his previous mistreatment of women? is he justifying madness? atoning?
	
	- the topic is indeed __contrition__: the emperor brings his brother to the woman, now living as a nun, unable to heal diseases. there we find the other sick sinners too. she refuses to cure them; they will be able to recover only after they confess sincerely. like hoccleve?

885. the sincere confession of the steward prompts both the emperor's anger and a second confession, by the earl's steward, who connects his account [_his version of the story, his segment of the chronology_] to the brother's one. the confession becomes a __narrative__, slowly connecting the different sections of the story, collectively.

952. the last line of the tale refers to the __inevitability__ of our own __death__. the empress forgives the four sinners, and she heals them all (confession is the unmaking of time - it links the past to the present). at the end of the four stories, the empress reveals her identity and concludes the narrative; __confession has become one with the poet's voice__. [_the poem has become a confession; and, as we have learnt, it was also an act of contrition._]

##The moral of the story

20. a surprising twist; the amicus visits hoccleve again, asks him where the __moral__ is - after having read the __translation__. hoccleve admits that he does not have it. the friend goes to his house to __fetch the moral__ from another edition of the same story, so that hoccleve can translate it into __english prose__, as he does. amicus has a reassuring role.

	- what follows is an extended __paraphrasis__ where every element of the story is matched with its __allegorical meaning__; the process of __interpretation__, in __unambiguous prose__. the explanation is __not entirely convincing__ (many details are left without their parallel). [_signifiers and signifieds do not entirely match; but there is a costant effort to align them again; this effort is lucidity and sanity._]

##Lerne to dye

86. the opening is an invocation to god, to have some new __wisdom__ from him. god responds by saying that the best thing one could learn is __how to die__: with sweetness. reason specifies that her project is not a __memento mori__; it is about the __disposition__ before the inevitable event that awaits everyone [_the awareness of inevitable death is given for granted; it requires no further exposition_]. this preparation is the most valuable teaching.

168. the disciple imagines a dying man; __imaginative__ is employed as a pedagogical means. the dying man then imagines death (__performance__ is a cardinal rhetorical and intellectual instrument in hoccleve - he inteprets ideas, he performs them mentally). __dialog__. [_hoccleve has much in common with langland._]

287. it is a fictional dialog between the man, disciple and poet, and personified death. the personified death [_imago mortis, the dying man_] complains about the ephemeral quality of life and __time__, and of his waste of devotion towards material pursuits. the problem is that he did not learn to die.

420. the personification can become a __mirror__ for the poet [_another crucial motive; the mirror is both the mirror of imaginative, the performance of imagination, and poetry as a way to know the self, to understand the ways in which the self would hypothetically operate (remember the hypothetical period in kafka; the cardinal device of betrachtung)_]; the discussion now concerns __repentance__ and its possibility so late in life. it is unthinkable for personified death. [_imago mortis is also the embodiment of despair._]

514. the disciple is now learning from the imago mortis how to learn to die. the personification has become the __teacher__. the method is again __imaginative personification__ (or performance); the image asks the poet to imagine his soul in purgatory, as he repents the time misspent.

623. hoccleve's problem - the disciple's - is here that of __reception__ - how can people be __persuaded__ [_what is the poetical, intellectual, pedagogical instrument_] that their behavior must change? the answer is that they must consider their death as the end of earthly suffering and the beginning of __true bliss__. they must consider __life a vision__.

740. a description of __death__ from the perspective of the dying man - slow list of symptoms. the image's speech ends with another imagined speech - that of the tormented souls of hell.

822. the poet has __absorbed__ the image of death [_a langlandian move; and one that reminds us of the conclusion of usk as well_]; he repents loudly, as he would, asking for mercy.

917. the final words are spoken by "sapience," who recommends __contrition__ and virtue to the poet. [_a final boethian turn._]

##The joys of heaven

- the poet explains that, since his power to compose [_verses_] is limited, he won't translate the entire book but only the description of the celestial jerusalem, and only in prose. bliss with __heavenly clarity__.

##Jonatha's tale

84. as a mirror to virtuous women, the friend suggests that hoccleve now [should] translate the tale of an unchaste woman; this should serve as an example against lechery. the tale is accepted.

182. the tale is a mixture of __romance__ and __parable__, with a young boy using the __talents__ of magic gifts.

301. the son wastes all of his mother's gifts for the love of his mistress. lecherous waste.

	- it is interesting to notice that the woman - fellicula - is met at the university. [_what does this imply? what sort of dangerous knowledge does she stand for?_]

497. in his journey home, jonathas falls ill and recovers from sickness. __old age__ and infirmity return here, as elements that constitute much of hoccleve's imagination [_both allegorical and very concrete_].

637. as in the previous tale, jonathas becomes a healer, and the villain can be cured only if she confesses. the inversion of gender might imply a progression for the poet [_an improvement in his condition, and an actual enlightment in his ability to understand and controll sin_].

	- this parable too is followed by a moral in prose, and by a dedication to lady westmoreland, to whom the book is dedicated.
