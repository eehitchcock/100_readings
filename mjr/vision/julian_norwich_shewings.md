##Ideas

- The temporality is that that separates the instant of sickness from that of its interpretation; or that of the fulfillment of its interpretation. Teaching occurs in the book both through the display and the conjuring of images that need to be interpreted, and through actual dialogue, reminiscent of the _dream vision_ pedagogical tradition. The book in fact consists in the alternation between these two modes - text and image (teo different notions of time?).

##Introduction

- composed between 1373 (year when the events happened) and 1393 (when the __longer version__ - six times the original - was completed).

- it is the __first known book__ written in english by __a woman__.

- julian was an anchorite in the convent of st. julian of norwich.

- it [_the short text_] survives in only __one manuscript__ - the amherst manuscript - this is the short text.

- the long text survives in 4 ms.; the one used by this edition [_the norton by denise baker_] was copied in the xvi s., and it modernized vocabulary and spelling.

##Commentary

1. the first chapter is an __index__ and a __method__. the visionary mode has become a deliberate __revelation of divinity__ through its physical presence in history - the xvi chapters correspond to different stages of his passion on earth, slowly becoming the teachings - the parts of a __pedagogical exposition__ of divine truths. [_also: this exposition only requires the simple contemplation of an everyday object, the crucifix. it is a revelation that is available to every christian; it is the interpretation of an experience that can be shared by any of us._]

	- there is a sense of endless expansion of a single instant. the moment in time is the revelation of the crown; and this contains all that will follow.

	- the revelations alternate between what is _seen_ and what is _known_ [_another idea to consider; vision and knowledge are integrated in the book_].

2. julian gives the context of her visions - she was a poor mortal creature, fallen sick in 1373. grace, knowledge, and sickness produced the religous experience.

	- as the characters of the second nun's tale, or the york cycle, julian wishes to __see and experience__, to know and to believe better - "i desyred a bodely sight."

	- seeing is a __mode of knowing__, not simply a means [_seeing is the most basic mode of knowing; here we find a profound difference from the imaginative capability found elsewhere; vision is here a self-sufficient capacity, an introduction to theological contemplation that leads to deeper truths; material vision is not deceiving or juxtaposed to a more genuine form of experience_].

	- sharing the passion is knowledge too.

3. accurate description of her sickness. she describes it objectively, mixing it with her desires [_sickness is another experience familiar to most people; it is also a negative experience, that julian redeems from its immediate associations with sin and death; even sickness, the trivial and unpleasant experience of sickness, can be turned into a divine instrument of religious contemplation_].

5. from the blood flowing from the crown we perceive __trinity__ (multiplicity in a single substance); from the __trinity__ we perceive the principles that construct everything else. here julian is given the __sphere__ that represents the entirety of creation [_it is small as a nut; it is homely, it is trivial and familiar in the associations that it evokes_]; it is a small, irrelevant thing, which whould not trouble us. the __vision__ has strong physical qualities, it is "as rounde as a balle"; it has __little weight__. [_it is a boethian teaching - the relative smallness of the universe when compared to the infinite eternity of god; but it is delivered through concrete and quotidian experience, not through distant contemplation and scientific knowledge - such as the order of the planets or the music of the spheres._]

7. we are contained within the holy body of christ - the body of christ is thge single principle which contains everything. julian uses __similes__ and __visual analogies__ to represent the __multiplicity__ that is already contained within the single vision [_but also to make her vision understandable and relatable by anyone; the homely images are the instruments of a universal pedagogy_]. the blood, for instance, reminds her of "pelettes," "scale of herryng," "droppes of the evesyng of a house."

9. julian qualifies her role as a visionary author; her __privilege__ and her grace. [_the crucial quotation to understand this concept is "i am here for the general"; i care about the general, the everybody._]

	- the __privilege__ is attainable through prayer and devotion. and her vision is simply a means to help her work towards salvation, __not salvation itself__. it is a purely intellectual aid. unity is again one of the principles used to explain this. [_vision is attainable by everyone, by experiencing the homely objects of her contemplation and by meditating on them as she does. salvation is attainable by everyone. we are all included in both._]

10. the second revelation is the __changing face of christ__ - covering every stage [_of life and death; of suffering and joy; of physical and spiritual pain; recognizable in any man_], from the __horror of sin__ to the perfection of heavenly bliss. julian is the _anti-cloud of unknowing_; she seeks the pictures in her mind, and she uses them as an intellectual tool for __theological meditation__, instead of rejecting them. here she sees the salvation at the bottom of the ocean.

11. the third revelation starts with some boethian notions about _fatum_ and _providence_ (although not explicitly in these terms), about the non-existence of sin and the full presence of righteousness; this is __pure consolation__.

	- poetical prose; here __anaphora__ with "see" [_things to see, in the imperative, to achieve insight and knowledge_].

12. the vision of christ's blood does not stain the sheets because it is the water that washes sins away. [_concrete image, twisted in a concrete way; the miraculous vision holds together two ideas that can be understood easily - water and blood, staining and washing away._]

13. __laughter__. julian laughs with __joy__ at the idea that the devil is always overcome. consolation [_and affective reaction modelled for the reader; the reader can be comforted and laugh freely_].

15. more happy visions: heaven and "wo and in wele"; christ is always next to us.

17. the eight revelation describes the gory particulars of christ's scourging and dehydrating. julian feels his pain - knowing that it is still better than hell's despair.

21. __universal compassion__ for god's sorrows. the entirety of humanity and nature participates in the divine suffering of jesus. in jesus' suffering, and in our empathy, is a sense of __consolation__ [_from unity, and the sense that we are in god, god is in us_].

23. a vision of the trinity in heaven, and of heaven as the trinity. theology through senses.

26. here we see the beginning of a __dialogue__ between the woman and the vision; it follows some of the conventions of the __dream vision__ genre. a __voice__ that instructs and consoles her. the writer answers with either her own words or her affective responses. the __vision__ becomes the __word__ [_is it not accompanied by the word?_] - poetically crafted. here we have the famous anaphora of "i it am"; unity in difference. ubiquity and inclusiveness.

	- from vision and senses to words (in time); he asks "wylte thou see her?" [_probably the virgin mary_].

32. another __boethian__ motive: the __need for evil and sin__ in history. again the meditation moves from vision and compassion - __physical senses__ - to __pure language__, and from there __speculation__ [_three stages: senses, language, speculation (pedagogy? contemplation? insight? teaching? knowledge?)_]. here we have the sequence of "i may... i can... i shalle... make alle thyng welle," where the __modals__ correspond to different faculties of the trinity.

40. the revelation about sin is one of the longest ones so far; it is a crucial point for julian. if we understand that __divinity__ is in __sin__ as well, we will see that divinity pervades every aspect of human existence. we are divine even when we sin.

	- the participation of the divine in every aspect of creation resonates with the __changing face__ [_of christ, between life and death and life beyond death_].

50. the theme of revelation xiv is __prayer__ as a means to seek god; it is the __verbal proximity__ between divinity and its human creature. julian explores the contradiction of __communicating__ with something of which we are a part, and that is a part of us. the contradiction is god's wrath - god cannot be angry at us. he is love. [_again, the principle is unity._]

51. at the core of this long exposition we find a __parable__ shown to julian; it is full of mysteries that need to be __interpreted__ (the book is always both a __revelation__ and its __interpretation__, the gloss that we use to understand its true meaning). the vision is that of a lord and his servant. the servant, while following the lord, falls in a pit/valley.

	- julian specifies that it is the process of __interpretation__ that took her __time__ - 20 years [_this is the opening; these twenty years are a cardinal element to consider further; these twenty years are the time of intepretation issued by the instant of vision; time is always a consequence of the instant_].

	- she keeps describing the vision - __forming it as a picture__ in her [_imaginative_] - in our mind - a manner to understand it better. the details of the vision are many and diverse; not all of them are explained [_just like in hoccleve_].

	- the interpretation is also the eternity of __time__ - the servant, "manhode," is both adam and christ.

	- many visual details are introduced and explained here; it is a rich and colorful illustration.

57. this section is an expansion of the vision; it insists on the __unity__ of god and humanity.

58. here julian notoriously changes the convention about __god's gender__ - god is our __mother__ now.

	- the following chapters expand this notion, exploring its causes and implications fully [_linguistic choice, then interpreted in understanding and contemplation_].

	- the comparison is very moving; julian is also describing what a __mother__ does for __love__.

63. on the conclusive note about maternity the xv revelation ends; a long meditation on __sin__ [_this is, then, the fundamental problem of the longest version; how do we include sin and sorrow within god's creation?_].

65. more consolation. the sorrow and decay of this mortal life is a temporary illusion, as fleeting as julian's visions (here a decaying corpse from which sprouts a baby).

	- the dream vision becomes a metaphor for __physical reality__, not simply an access to metaphysics. [_that is, the genre of dream vision, the fact that it is characterized by being ephemeral and imaginary, is applicable to our understanding of life on earth, of mortality; again, as the characters in the second nun's tale explain, "we have been dreaming until now"_].

70. the vision of a __fiend__; the consolation is, again, the fact that it is just an __illusion__.

	- __fear__ is always transient, and followed by lasting words of __consolation__. here "thou shalt not be ovyrcom." visions and words institute a dynamic relationship in time. contradictory? [_probably because interpretation - verbal paraphrasis of vision - lasts, whereas vision is fleeting._]

75. this section is a psychological profile of the christian; her visions, her love, her dread. these can all be ways to access the divine truths sought by julian. the assumption is that by looking at ourselves and at our desire for divinity, we will understand divinity better. __interiority__ [_and unity_].

80. among julian's most recognizable stylistic features we find her tendency to organize thoughts in __lists__, like the ones seen in the parson's tale. she strives for clarity too. numbers: unit and many. [as in dante, after pythagoras, one is the principle of everything._]

86. the conclusion turns to the unity of the motto "i it am" into a __visual alliteration__ - "lyfe, love, light."
