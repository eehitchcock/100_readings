##Ideas

- The poem seems to belong to the same alliterative and socially engaged tradition of _Piers Plowman_; indeed, it presents analogous __types__ that seem to correspond to socially recognizable identities - not simply allegory, but synecdoche.

- The debate soon becomes problematic; but, at least initially, the two social types - winner and waster - seem to correspond to formal and rhetorical types; the two characters _argue_ differently (the conclusion seems to be that both sides are necessary - very Langlandian.

##Introduction

- transcribed - in its only extant version - in __1450__, by thornton; written in the __midlands__ between __1350__ and __1370__. its language is that of a __national__ (even _international_) dialect. some references seem __topical__, and help us with dating.

- it is a __dream vision__ where we find a debate whose solution remain _uncertain_.

- the form shifts between __allegory__ and __satire__; the two characters stand for specific types.

##Commentary

- 6. deceit is part of english history since brutus (rememembered as one of the men who tricked the trojans); but the __unreliability of words__ has progressively increased.

- 16. from foundation to apocalypse, the incipit leaps to __contemporary tragedy__.

- 23. a change in genre and literary taste followed the ruin: now there is no more space for happy songs and words, nor for romance. reality changed art.

- 30. the art of a poet is described as a "__werke__," the __labor__ of a skilled professional.

- 46. the tone changes abruptly - from the bleak incipit to a wonderful __locus amoenus__ (full of _sounds_: birds and the streams), where the poet falls asleep.

- 68. two armies are waiting for a prince that could pacify their struggle. the tone is that of epic - but a __colorful__ (many _colors_!), marvelous one.

	- notice the contradiction here - the dreamer is in a foreign space, perhaps not "in the werlde," but the _banners_ and symbols (and writings) are all "ynglysse."

- 84. the king is a proud warrior who also wears precious pearls and silk.

- 96. there is something striking about him - he mixes __regal__ and __natural__ elements, a combination between a _nobleman_ and a __wild man__. he has fowls in his beard.

- 123. the king sends a messenger to the two armies, to impose peace. the messenger is a perfect knight, in an invincible armor. his description contrasts with the _wild k._

- 155. a description of the two armies - they are truly __international__; their banners are described thoroughly. so far only some __hints__ might suggest an allegorical reading - the poem follows the pattern of _epic_ and _history_.

	- the enemies include religious groups; the poet also describes their beliefs.

	- the idea is that the __pope__ and his men (orders) are fighting with __england__ and __france__.

- 196. the banners - or, rather, the soldiers' attributes and accessories, are described carefully in their __material__ and their construction. the __entirety of society__ seems now gathered in this field; but the main rivals are religious.

- 217. the vision is very elaborate - so much that the dreamer has to remind us of his actual presence in the scene. he does so by sharing a drink with the characters.

- 245. the two __allegorical personifications__ represent __antithetical__ (or perhaps _complementary_) components of society. one gathers, the other spends. from the first section we might assume that _wynnere_ stands for the "laboratores" (farmers?), while _wastoure_ is one of the "bellatores" (noblemen?). they are both representatives and assistants for them.

- 262. the answer by _wastoure_ problematizes the contrast - wynnere, in his refusal to get rid of what he collects, could even be considered a __sinner__; and such is the case. we are little with little space to determine who is the __embodiment of virtue__, who of __sin__.

- 293. there is some strong _social resentment_ in wynnere's speech - the feeling that a part of society exploits the labor of another one. the speech uses lively description of familiar spaces - halls, taverns, fields - and utterances and gestures associated to a specific __category__ in order to give shape and vividness to its abstraction - its personification. the embodiment of a waster acts just like one.

- 323. wastoure's speech is different; he invokes the scriptures and the philosophical authorities; he uses metaphors that are abstract and highly imaginative; he __argues__ logically, and on the premise of _ethical worth_, not material needs (or, again, social resentment). he simply thinks that hoarding is _religiously and morally wrong_, and he uses different discourses to prove it (the two personifications are fighting with _different weapons_). at one point (313) he wishes that all the other _allegorical personifications_ were drowned.

- 367. wynnere is a __hoarder of nouns__. here we have a rich, colorful description of a _sumptuous feast_ for few people (the conclusion of the passage could even be considered socialist or proto-socialist: better one meal a day than a single huge feast). this chatracter uses a simple argumentation: an empty stomach.

- 391. wastoure embraces the __material__ side of the conversation (this is a _new fitt_), and he makes a very fine point - economically complex. _waste is necessary to economy_, that is the assumption - and, if it were not for the rich, the poor would be poorer.

- 422. accordingly, wynnere's speech becomes more __elaborate__ too; there are two implications here, apparently. the first one is that __resources__ might be finite, so that the new rich might be exhausting the wealth of their forefathers. the second is a praise of the __evangelical__ humbleness found, for instance, in the _virgin mary_.

- 435. wastoure's claim is that luxury has an important __social function__; manners and elegance should be praised as virtuous. his speech is based on the assumption that life on earth is __ephemeral__, so that one should do his best to enjoy its _fortunes_ - they will not last. eventually, wastoure asks the king where they should fight.

- 471. the king determines to separate the two contenders; wynnere will travel to _rome_, wastoure to _london_ (cheapside). each will teach to the people living there, how to hoard, and how to waste. as the conclusion explains, waste ill make the economy of the city thrive. in the end, the king will bring gifts to _france_.
