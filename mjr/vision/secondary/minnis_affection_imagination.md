#Alastair Minnis: Affection and Imagination in the "Cloud of Unknowing" and Hilton (1983)

|Concepts|
|:---:|
|In the pseudo-dyonisian tradition, affect is a cognitive faculty used to access divine truths; with imagination, it is detached from the physical world as it approaches the highest spheres of knowledge; the Cloud author appropriates this tradition, first embracing, then rejecting the deployment of sensory images|

- Minnis studies the texts of the __pseudo-dyonisian__ tradition in their __historical context__; she wishes to stress the theological differences between then and today; she focuses on the concepts of __imagination and affection__.

	- __imaginatio__ was the faculty used to convey __spiritual and invisible truths__ by means of __liknesseses and images__; some of these (e. g., _the song of songs_) were devised to __move the reader__; pseudo-dyonisus discussed this.

1. "_the cloud of unknowing_"

	- minnis briefly sketches the reception history of pseudo-dyonisus, from hugh of saint victor in s. xii to the parisian commentators of s. xiii; this led to a debate on the __different human faculties__ involved in __science__; __intellect__ is used for __human science__, and __affect__ for __divine science__ (theology), although the hierarchy was often disputed.

	- in the genealogy of the ideas discussed in the cloud of unknowing, thomas gallus's interpretation of pseudo-dyonisus plays a crucial role; he placed __affect__ as the __utmost cognitive faculty__ used to approach god; __human intelligence__ could reach higher objects through __imagination__, and prompted by __will__ and __affection__.

	- at its highest level, __imagination is detached from "all sensible and intelligible things"__; at the end of his exposition, gallus adopted the __via negativa__, the description of divinity only through __negation__ of every sensible attribute (thus stretching language); this is the moment when the __excess of light__ produced by the experience of divinity becomes __darkness__ - a __cloud of unknowing__.

	- gallus's ideas on affect and imagination probably influenced deeply the commentators of grosseteste, although gallus's synthetic exposition probably remained more popular, and directly influenced the cloud author, who similarly placed "__love__" at the core of his spiritual system ("affectus"); love is, for the two authors, the "__highest cognitive power__."

	- following the pseudo-dyonisian tradition, the cloud author contrasts the "__knowable might__" and the "__loving might__"; they are __two distinct faculties__, and one does not lead to the other.

	- the description of the __cloud of unknowing__ itself is indebted to that of gallus's "caligo"; and the cloud author seems to endorse gallus's condemnation of __imagination__ almost completely; however, he uses __figurative language__ often in his work - and this is the "__major literary paradox__" of the work; according to minnis, the cloud author uses "__rich symbolism and imagery__" in a __contradictory__ way; but this contradiction, he continues, was already part of the pseudo-dyonisian tradition, which disagreed on the way that the bible attributed sensible qualities to divine beings; for part of this tradition, followed by the cloud author, the sensible attributes initially projected onto god have to be __progressively removed__ - as if __carved away__.

	- the cloud author occasionally __evokes and denigrates imagination__ (and the __antrhopomorphization__ of divine or transcendent beings); imaginative language is inevitable, yet it must always be __overcome__ (it is used __analogically__).

	- the descriptions of the cloud itself exemplify very well the problem of __imagination__ - the cloud is first evoked, then rejected; for minnis, the cloud author remarkably identifies "darkness in light" with "light in darkness," somehow __counterintuitively__; but this is a __motive__ already found in __pseudo-dyonisus__, grosseteste, and gallus - god's intense light produces darkness ("abbaglio").

	- the cloude of unknowing uses the "crafte of imagynacioun" to transcend it.

2. _hilton's "scale of perfection"_

	- elsewhere in his writings, the cloud author admits that the way to reach divine perception can at times __combine__ meditation and imagination; similar ideas are further developed in hilton's "scale of perfection."

	- for hilton, knowledge of the divine is acquired in __stages__; __imagination__ is a crucial component of the process, at least initially; men should meditate on the sensible forms of christ's existence on earth; however, __imagination__ should later be replaced by __intellect__ in the works of __contemplation__ [very different from gallus]; in all three degrees of contemplation, affect plays a key role.

	- hilton discusses the problem of __idolatry__ as well; religious images found in churches can be __powerful aids__ for contemplation, rather than distractions [this seems to produce an identification between the images sculpted by words and those painted or carved in churches]; they can be useful because they often "both __teach__ and __move__."

	- the cloud addresses only the __highest point of contemplation__, while hilton explores its full range of options; hilton ultimately incorporated imaginative thinking, intellect, and common human reason.
