#James Dean: Dismantling the Canterbury Book

- dean addresses the problem of __textual units__ in the ct; fragment 1, for instance, is an __undisputed__ unit - __thematic and narrative__; the ending of the poem, on the other hand, is problematic.

	- dean supports the order that we find in the __ellesmere ms.__, then contends that the __last four units__ that we find in it - _second nun_, _canon yeoman's_, _manciple_, parson_, and the _retraction_, belong to a __single cluster__, again thematically coherent; they constitute chaucer's attempt to both __close__ and __dismantle__ his project; it is a way to "__expose the architectonic features__" of the tales.

	- the focus of this section would be the __transformation__ of souls and __symbols__; the __underlying theme__ is that of the __search for truth__ (in a secularized, corrupt world, where the crow is black and silent).

	- for dean, chaucer thematizes the problematic __search for truth__ by __dismantling__ the __structure__ of his book __layer by layer__, from the "truth within a story" to "chaucer the man" composing the text of the collection.

	- then he inserts a __climax of progressive detachment__ from __storytelling__ - starting with the __embodied truth__ of __saint cecilia__, to the __inconclusive tale__ and the __non-tale__ of the end.

1. for dean, cecilia in the _second nun's tale_ represents an __ideal__, heaven itself (for dean she is similar to __pearl__); she __embodies__ this __truth__ in her name - indeed, she is always acknowledged as __truth__ itself from the first encounter; the tale tells the emergence of truth.

2. the canon yeoman's tale is an __answer__ to the second nun's __idealistic tale__; dean seems to suggest that it also stands for a __different era__; it would be a move from the "__age of martyrs__" to the __complex secular world__ of the present; for dean, the yeoman would in fact constitute a perfect __opposite__ of the _second nun_; and the alchemist is a sort of devil..

3. the second nun's tale shifts from __dreams__ to __truth__, while the yeoman's from __truth__ to __delusions__; the manciple's is a "__loss of truth and dreams altogether__"; the manciple's tale is an __explicitly pagan__ tale it contains elements of fabliau, myth, and fable, and it features a protagonist that often stands for the very idea of poetry; it is a __mixture__ of genres which incorporates __demythologizing__ and ends with __impotence__ and __silence__.

4. the parson's tale gets rid of both story and pilgrim storyteller; it is a __sermon__, although __inelegant__; there is a strong sense of __eschatology__ and __doom__ in the conclusion; the prologie connects the trope of the __pilgrimage__ to its __spiritual meaning__; the tale itself indicates __practical ways__ to __repel sin__; they are a __starting point__, just like the __unfinished pilgrimage__.

5. the retraction occurs outside the frame of the canterbury tales, acknowledging both __writer__ and __writing__ as __concrete__, self-standing entities, distinct from the __time__ of the __retraction__. 

	- the retraction is often regarded as a __conventional piece__; but for dean it is __sincere__ and __deliberate__, and the final sequence of ellesmere strategically precedes it.
