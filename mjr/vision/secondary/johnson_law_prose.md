#Johnson - English Law and the Man of Law's "Prose" Tale

- johnson addresses the confusion between __prose__ and __verse__ in the _man of law's tale_ (he promises prose, but he delivers verse); the man of law would at this time be __performing__ his __legal craft__ in order to be exonerated from any __blame__ of __legal corruption__.

	- legal practice, literary practice, and a response to an antilegal sentiment would be intersecting in the tale; the whole second fragment of the ct would constitute this __elaborate performance__ [_and be a coherent whole_; this is a very powerful idea; that the canterbury tales as a whole, then, should be read as several distinct performances by these social types].
