|Key-words|Concepts|
|:---:|:---:|
|Imagination; Nature; Teaching|Imagination bridges the gap between natural knowledge, developed through intellect and the senses, and acquired knowledge, derived directly from the scripture.|

- Karnes starts by comparing __medieval__ types of __knowledge__ - __natural knowledge__, draen from the __intellect__ and the __senses__, and __revelation__ (or "acquired knowledge"), from the __bible__.

	- the two kinds of knowledge correspond to two kinds of science, and two kinds of theology (_natural theology_ and _supernatural theology_); __pure intellectual powers__, without the giode of supernatural theology, frequently err.

	- langland names the two categories "__kynde knowynge__" and "__clergie__"; according to karnes, the role of __clergie__ should be regarded as __crucial__; __natural knowledge__ depends on __revelation__.

	- __ymaginatif__ is __the faculty that mediates between the two kinds of knowledge)); it is the capacity to __see the spiritual in the natural__ - "the spiritual becomes the natural" and "will simply lives biblical narrative"; it takes "sustained intellectual effort" to make "proper, spiritual use of the _natural world_."

	- after the twelfth century - with the "__discovery of nature__" - to the two types of knowlegde correspond the elements of a __broader dichotomy__ (__vernacular, affective piety__ against __latin, institutional theology__); according to this divide, "vernacular theology" is always "natural" and "anti-academic."

	- this distance would express a "fundamental division between the __lay__ and the __learned__"; but these are actually __interdependent worlds__.

	- the project of piers plowman is precisely to show this __interdependence__; __ymaginatif__ is the instrument through which "lived experience" (nature) becomes spiritual.

1. _nature in the late middle ages_
	
	- the __natural world__ had been identified as a source for __spiritual and divine learning__ since the early __middle ages__; it was a school that required __diligent__ and __rational__ study.

	- the __senses__ are the "first point of access to __spiritual truth__"; for langland, nature has become "__hard to read__" - almost __opaque__.

	- the senses are "error-prone," but easy to use.

	- one major swift in the study of nature occurred in the xiii s., when aristotelian ideas - nature as a container of immanent [physical] truths - replaced neoplatonic ones - nature as a symbol of transcendent [metaophysical] truths; the instrument used to turn aristotelian immanent [physical] truths into theological [metaphysical] truths is __imagination__.

2. _langland's natural theology_

	- according to karnes, will's initial problem is the __interpretation__ of the world according to the senses - he has to __train the senses__, or to __develop instruments__ to __interpret the experience__ drawn from them.

	- will has a will that occasionally does not respond to him; and he has a faulty understanding of __natural theology__.

	- therefore, the beginning of the search for _dowell_, guided by will's intellectual faculties, is destined to fail.

	- karnes analyzes the conflict between __wit__ and __studie__ as one exemplary instance of the __insufficiency__ of the senses to do theological work.

3. _the ymaginatif doctrine_

	- ymaginatif is schooling will in the "rudiments of natural theology"; his technique is based on the __observation of nature__; his style abounds in __metaphors and puns__.

4. _aristotelian imagination_

	- in aristotle, __imagination__ - or __phantasia__ - is the intellect's faculty to __create images__, drawing from __memory__ and combining perception into new forms; __imagination__ turns the experience perceived by the senses into __intangible images__ that the intellect can process; it was a fundamental __cognitive faculty__.

5. _will's lesson learned_

	- imagination is - therefore - a capacity for __abstraction__ (the "literary"?); the final section of the poem turns will's life into a vita christi - into the world portrayed by scripture, or scripture itself; indeed, quotations from the bible - in latin - become more frequent towards the end of the poem; it is also a strategy through which, by using an __affective faculty__, man ascends to god.
