#Signifying God - Social relation and symbolic act in the York Corpus Christi Plays

- _Introduction_

	- the book exolores the relationshio between __sacrament__ and __representation__ in the ycc; the idea is that of __presentation__ and __presence__; the document that we possess concerns a __custom__ that lasted from at least 1376 until 1569.

	- beckwith defines the scope of the practice by counting the __ten to sixteen__ stations involved; a __huge spectacle__ deployed to __signify__ an even broader object - the __history of everything__; an "__astonishingly polysemous__" theater, with a __tenth of the city involved__ in the __many productions__ happening at the same time (she invites us to think about the __number of satans__, jesus and mary wandering through the streets); Beckwith intends to identify the genre as "sacramental" theater; she also wants to explore how the symnolic relations enacted on the stage mirrored the social relations of the community involved (labor organization); then she considers how the dramatic form represented the __body of christ__ (the actor's body; the __eucharist__, and __penance__); the plays do __theological work__; they are "sacramental theater" in a way that is almost inconceivable for us, although some of its implications survive today.

##Part One: Ruins and revival

1. _The present of past things_

	- the focus of the york plays is __what and how to remember__; they celebrate _corpus christi_ by performing a fiction similar to __transubstantiation__ - __memory__ through __repetition__; although they __raised__ the problem of __distinguishing__ beteween __religious signification__ and __blasphemous imitation__ [a crucial problem].

	- the plays turn the city of york into the __landscape of christian history__; the decision to transcribe them was probably an attempt to turn their memory into another memory; they were suppressed during the reformation period , and revived after ww ii.

	- beckwith analyzes the link between the cycle and ruins, physical manifestations of __nostalgia__; the plays were enacted against __places of memory__; today they embody memory.

##Part Two: Social relation and symbolic act

2. _Ritual, theater and social space in the York Corpus Christi cycle_

	- beckwith [explains] how christianity is a cult based on __synecdoche__ and __metaphor__; the suffering of an individual redeems the sins of the world; christ's body is the center of this __culture__; the plays define the culture and the community that recognize themselves in christ; it is a collective ritual of __identification__.

	- the problems in the ritual concern the broader issue of __signifying god__ - an entity devoid of __recognizable__, immanent features; how does one __represent god__?

	- for beckwith, the body of christ contains and represents a set of __contradictions__; she emphasizes the __complex__ role of the word __mene__ in the plays; around the __body of christ__, the plays develop a complex __network of relationships__ among characters; besides, the city itself becomes a __body__ engaged in __meaningful interactions__; beckwith traces the history of the mapping of the city and the stations; these were __negotiated__ depending on __wealth__ and __legal authority__; their position corresponded to the sites of __prestige__ and __visibility__; __politic and economic interests__ determined the shape of this theatrical space; the staging of christian history was embedded in contemporary social questions, and it depended on them.

3. _work, markets, civic structure: organizing the york corpus christi plays_

	- beckwith argues that the production of the plays did not blur but enforce class divisions; she explains that god's insistence on __work__ in the plays of genesis contradicts the assumption for which __creation__ ought to have been __effortless__; "work" becomes a signifier of many distinct kinds of labor, uniting god, noah, [adam, ] divine and human work.

	- beckwith then explores the implications of the initial monologues of creation, where god makes things exist simply by __naming__ them; work is also what characterizes adam and eve after the fall, together with their naked body - it is the beginning of history, time and sacrament as memory; the mortal body becomes the body of the city, __regulated__ in __labor__ to make the body of christ.


##Part three: Sacramental theater

4. _Real presences: the york crucifixion as sacramental theater_

	- beckwith first emphasizes the contradictions of the plays as a sacrament - condemned by the reformation for their scandalous __spectacularization__ of theological mysteries - sacraments existing between __visible__ and __invisible__, with the crucial indecidibility of the __eucharist__ - that __theophany__ too was a spectacle and a performance.

	- beckwith then explores the __semiotics of theater__, where everything is a "__sign__"; the central sign is the actor's body; beckwith analyzes the ways that the actor's body, and the props and actors around him, became meaningful in the __passion__ section.

5. _presence after presentness: the theater of resurrection in york_

	- here beckwith stresses the __importance of vision__ in the cycle - the perception of christ's body after death, a proof of his __divinity__, but also one of the __mechanisms of theater__ in general - bodies that stand for dead bodies; she then presents evidence from the gospels and theological texts documenting the __importance of the empty sepulcher__ in the understanding of __mystery__ - his spatial __absence as a sign__ of __his presence__ elsewhere; it is a symbol that __problematically interacts__ with the __fetishizing of the eucharist__ (and christ's dead body); theater allows us to imagine christ elsewhere.

6. _penance, presence, punishment_

	- this chapter explores the implications of the cycle when understood as a __collective ritual of penance__; beckwith frames it through the obligations of confession of __1215__; eucharist and confession became instruments of __collective harmony__, part of a complex __economy of sin__; beckwith explains how confession was both private and collective, part of a yearly public performance; it also had __juridical value__; finally, it was the sacrament that most explicitly developed the interaction between laity and ; beckwith then explains the lollard reaction to this complex overlapping of interests; she suggests that the __trials__ surrounding the passion in the ycc plays are supposed to problematize and perhaps __shape__ these performances; she examines how the audience is __implicated__ in the trials - and in the sinful but necessary choices leading to his crucifixion; the condemnation of christ's body is as necessary as the punishment of heresy in the xiv s.


##Part four: Reform

7. _Theaters of signs and disguises: the reform if the york corpus christi plays_

	- here beckwith intends to prove that the abolition of the ycc plays during the reform corresponded to a broader, and more profound, theological change in the understanding of __visibility__, spectacle, and their importance for __christian beliefs__; she defines the process as the separation of theology and theater; she also examines some of the __social and economic__ developments that made this kind of production less easy to stage.

	- __ritual and theater__ became forms of __disguise__, not identity.

##Part five: Revival

8. _By the people for the people: the gift of god for the people of god_

	- in this chapter beckwith examines the problems that "__signifying god__" in this cycle posed for xx s. productions.
