#Signifying God - Social relation and sybmbolic act in the York Corpus Christi Plays

- _Introduction_

	- the book exolores the relationshio between __sacrament__ and __representation__ in the ycc; the idea is that of __presentation__ and __presence__; the document that we possess concerns a __custom__ that lasted from at least 1376 until 1569.

	- beckwith defines the scope of the practice by counting the __ten to sixteen__ stations involved; a __huge spectacle__ deployed to __signify__ an even broader object - the __history of everything__; an "__astonishingly polysemous__" theater, with a __tenth of the city involved__ in the __many productions__ happening at the same time (she invites us to think about the __number of satans__, jesus and mary wandering through the streets); Beckwith intends to identify the genre as "sacramental" theater; she also wants to explore how the symnolic relations enacted on the stage mirrored the social relations of the community involved (labor organization); then she considers how the dramatic form represented the __body of christ__ (the actor's body; the __eucharist__, and __penance__); the plays do __theological work__; they are "sacramental theater" in a way that is almost unconceivable for us, although some of its implications survive today.

##Part One: Ruins and revival

1. _The present of past things_

	- the focus of the york plays is __what and how to remember__; they celebrate _corpus christi_ by performing a fiction similar to __transubstantiation__ - __memory__ through __repetition__; although they __raised__ the problem of __distinguishing__ beteween __religious signification__ and __blasphemous imitation__ [a crucial problem].
