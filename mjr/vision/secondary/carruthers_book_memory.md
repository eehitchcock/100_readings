#Mary Carruthers: The Book of Memory

- _Introduction_.

	- Carruthers starts by comparing the __medieval__ focus on memory with the current - __modern__ - focus on __imagination__; memory, today, is understood as a __passive__ faculty, whereas imagination, for medievals subordinated to the sensitive soul - is where creativity resides.

	- carruthers compares a description of __einstein__ and one of __aquinas__, creative geniuses of their times; they were praised for the same reasons - __originality__ and __focus__ - but with different __terms__.

	- she then explains how aquinas's later works were probably __dictated__ from __memory__, without any sort of __preliminary draft__ (__1270s__) - from __mental composition__.

	- memory and concentration seem to have been deeply linked in aquinas's practice; memoria was deemed crucial for the intellectual abilities of a person; it was a faculty that required __training__, and for which there existed specific __techniques__; one was to "__divide__" material into manageable units - __organizing__ it in order to __access__ each section __more easily__; this __ordering__ and the following __recollection__ both required __deep__ and __sustained__ concentration.

	- understandably, medieval scholars had to rely on memory more often, due to the paucity of books in circulation.

	- books were also devised as __aids for memory__ - their __visual ordinatio__ was meant to be __impressed__ onto the mind of the reader - learner.

	- __memoria__ was essential to both the __literary practice__ and moral judgement; memoria is the first stage of reception of a text (its capacity to leave an __impression__), leading to __institutionalization__.

	- carruthers introduces a dichotomy between __fundamentalism__ and __textualism__ to explain the role of memory in the __reception__ history of a text; __fundamentalists__ consider the text __self-sufficient__, and its interpretation __solely literal__; __textualists__ require the presence of a __textual community__ around a text, to __interpret__ and __discuss__ its meaning - and this is where __memoria__ plays an __important__ role.

	- as it is __received__ and __interpreted__ (read, understood, debated, and glossed), a text is __textualized__; they become part of a __collective__, __social memory__.

	 - carruthers highly emphasizes the __ethical importance of memory__.

	- she then explains that, although medieval intellectual history is usually read as a move from __neoplatonism__ (augustine, matter/spirit dichotomy) to __aristotelism__ ("hylemorphism" - compenetration of __matter__ and __form__ - and thomas aquinas), memory does not conform to this shift; memoria is a __praxis__; it was a __practical technique__ that had broad cultural ripercussions; it was a __widespread element__ of __basic education__.

	- carruthers starts her book by describing __two leading metaphors__ used for __memoria__ - a "set of __waxed tables__" and a "__storehouse__" or "__inventory__"; then she considers its __psychosomatic__ functioning and its repercussions on __ethical customs__; then she describes some __mnemonic techniques__ based on the __organization of knowledge__ (almost __spatial__); then the reinvention of classical rhetoric and its techniques; finally, she investigates the reasons for which memoria was highly esteemed, and its effects on __ordinatio__.

1. _Models of memory_.

	- _Tabula memoriae_; memory was not alternative to writing; in fact, __writing__ was regarded as an __aid to memory__; and memory was the __creation__ of a __visual impression__ of an object, to be analyzed and retreived as one wished; for carruthers, memory has always been understood as __visual__ (even before the book); it was a faculty that resulted in the immediate ability to manipulate a text (a text truly remembered can be recited __backwards__, and at will); the purpose of memory was __investigatio__ - to be able to __find__ and __retrieve__ stored information - not repetition.

		-  __memory__ creates a __functional__ and __partial__ image of the object - a __linguistic__ depiction; it is also __material__ and __spatial__ (not __temporal__, like __aural reception__); it is __metaphoric__ in that it replaces __signs__ for the "real things" (aristotle recommended using the letters of the alphabet to memorize things in order).

	- _Thesaurus sapientae_; the metaphor of the __storeroom__ had less to do with the production of memory, and more with its __organization__; this organization has to be __constructed__ and trained by the individual; the image was a __malleable__ one in the __middle ages__ - at times it became a sort of __artificial nesting structure__ for __birds__ (consider both _the parliament of fowls_ and _the house of fame_); __birds__, and especially pigeons, were often identified with memories in the m.a.; other images focused on __construction__ (the bee-hive) and __collection__ (the money purse), or __concealment__ (a cave or recess), or __precious possession__ (shrine, chest); carruthers emphasizes the __double connotation__ of one of the words used in latin - __arca__, either _noah's ark_ or the _ark of the covenant_ (__ordinatio__ as the process that makes __texts__ - food - ready for __digestion__ - memorization or storage; not everything can be assimilated in the same way, not everything __should__ be assimilated in the same way) - __eating__ being one of the metaphors used for memorization, together with __memory__ as the heart.

		- the ark of memory holds together __time__. it is a metaphor for education and "the book" (_the bible_).

2. _Descriptions of the neuropychology of memory_.

	- all premodern (and beyond) accounts of memory divide it into __storage__ and __recollection__.

	- in early discussions of memory, the notion was connected to __mediational prayer__.

5. _Memory and the ethics of reading_.

	- here carruthers analyzes the relationship between __memoria__ and the __raise of reading__; reading and memorization were connected both in their imaginary roles and in the practice of __literacy__; for carruthers, the quick developments in the __ordinatio__ of scholarly books in the xii s. suggests that they simply conformed to a pre-existing tradition - an oral custom of __glossing__, __dividing__, __organizing__ information; carruthers insists on the notion that memoria was a reliable tool for the recording of information, later substituted by writing; reading was a process of __personal assimilation__ of a text - memorization that has personal value, not objective; this process was defined "__ruminatio__" - a digestive metaphor that left a strong impression on the writers of the time; carruthers lists
