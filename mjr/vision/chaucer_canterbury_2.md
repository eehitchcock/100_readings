#The Canterbury Tales - Fragment 2

##The Man of Law in the Prologue

830. the description focuses on subtlety; the character is less colorful than his peers - he is a serious worker, dressed somberly, who works hard for the law.

	- in a subtle way, ch. suggests that he might be greedy and too sly in his business;
	
	- apparently, he knows well how to bend language to suit his own interests.

##Text- Introduction

15. the elaborate __astronomical description__ of the sun's position is either a periphrasis or an actual __deduction__ [_by the host_] retold in detail; in any case, it seems almost parodic.
	
	- certainly a verbose way to convey a simple information, ill suited for the character.

32. the __sublime__ and the __trivial__ - the cosmic tragedy of __irretrievable time__, of time spent as time lost forever, is compared to "malkynes maydenhede."

96. the speech that leads to the tale is rhetorically dense; the character first reminds us of the __importance of the law__ [_this section will acquire a different meaning once we learn that the topic of his tale is conversion, and the different religious laws that forbid it; conversion to christianity as an illegal fact._]; then he addresses chaucer, either to appeal to him or - with subtlety - to criticize him; he remembers some legends of __good women__ from his juvenile work, but only to stress what was missing (darker stories that he nevertheless cites); he declares his loathing for verses [_he will not stell his story in verses._].

	- therefore his speech is literally a __prose translated__ into a poem; emphasis on __mediation__.

133. a terrifying opening, with a condemnation of __poverty__ as the worst possible condition for the human - worse than death. ethically problematic, of course (the mol was richly dressed). the tale itself was suspposedly told him by a __merchant__, who saw __wonders__ abroad.

##The tale

194. for now the tone is that of a __romance__; it starts with a journey from exotic syria to rome; it praises the richness of the merchants travelling. the metre is __rime royal__.

196. the first __supernatural__ (or _religious_?) element: the voice about the emperor's beautiful daughter is carried, as a commodity, from rome to syria. the sultan falls in love through it, but in the __stars__ we find written - they are a __book__ - that he will die.

	- these are the two centers of religion, and above them a __single book__ for every human destiny.

315. the standpoint (perspective) shifts from the sultan to the empress; the focus is still on the contrast between the __readable__ or __unreadable__ sky (which, apparently, muslims can decypher better than christians) and the free will of humans. this __astrological__ (or _providential_?) discourse is applied to a clash or religions, now higlighted by the sultan's conversion to christianity and the girls' reluctance to marry.

385. the first part sees the evil plotting of the sultan's mother, a wicked woman whose plan prompts a msysogynistic attack uttered by the __narrator___. her speech reverts the vocabulary of christianity: islam has a god, a set of __holy lawes__ and a __helle__, where muslims would end up if they convert to another faith.

	- the passage - the very problem that it poses - should be compared with the praise of __lawfulness__ contained in the _prologue_; the man of law is discussing the __diverse laws__ found in diverse cultures bridged by commerce and empires. relativism - is it praised or scorned?

427. a short meditation on the __ephemerality__ of __happiness__ (it has a __boethian__ flavor) marks the shift from the __celebration of the wedding__ to the __slaughter__of groom and his court.

	- the bloody and unexpected episode - the fulfilment of a __prophecy__, though - happens on a ship. [_another poetical trope? are ships a part of the boethian vocabulary of metaphors as well?_]

483. the __aventure__ definitely has some boethian elements - here a comment on the __unscrutability__ of god's design (__providence__), who surprisingly prevented the empress from being killed, and from dying at sea. she prays god and the lamb - christ - to keep her safe from the devil.

504. the poet emphasizes every contradiction and implausibility of romance; justified as divine.

	- did she survive - how? how did she avoid tempests? how did she find food? __impossible grace__.

553. the ship arrives to an archaic england, where there are no christians but only __pagan invaders__. the empress - constance - communicates with them in a "maner latyn corrupt." [_fantasy of a prelinguistic world, of a world preceding the spread of vernaculars._]

	- so that the focus is __confession and conversion__; now the queen is a foreigner in this land.

637. perhaps the whole story is __a metaphor for the preservation of the church__ - but wouldn't this be canonical for the genre of romance, in any case? the two opposing forces are christ and satan, embodied in the historical characters (not precisely embodied - rather, "represented by," and "affecting the" who love and die on earth. here the devil is using a knight - his __lechery__ - to have constance condemned of murder.

693. a __miracle__ - two visions: the pale face of constance, praying, similar to a __sinful__ man led to his death, and the __sudden death__ of the lecherous knight, his face disfigured after he swore on the briton gospels, prompt the conversion of the king alla - and his marriage to the empress. __to see is to believe__, phenomena. [_think about the york cycle and its obsession with the miracle, from joseph to thomas._]

756. __substittution__; the passage starts with a new emphasis on the __foreign language__ spoken here; then the evil queen's plot is enacted - she forges a wicked miracle that might deceive the king - the story of an elf queen, sorcery, and a monstrous child. the elements are those of __pagan folklore__ - the same found in romance. [_the substitution is that of a letter, a written document sent by the queen to the king, whose truth is replaced by the false tales of paganism. the focus of the story is on true and false; like in a legal case, the forged documents prove the opponent wrong._]

875. some crucial elements of the story - the drunken messenger, the ship of unscrutable destiny - could be drawn from __boethian imagery__. the story is becoming highly __allegorical__ - the woman could stand for the church or the soul - either a __parable__ or a __miracle__ - a vision, in that it's an __earthly manifestation of divinity__.

945. another miracle - constance kills a man who was trying to rape her; again a sequence of __biblical exempla__ aimed at making the unlikeliness of romance __believable__. [_notice her increasing ability to actively affect the world; she kills the man, whereas in the previous section the man was killed by divine intervention._]

966. a short description of some __imperial__ destruction brought to __syria__ from rome - a __synecdoche__ for the __crusades__? notice the technique of romance, the swift changes in perspective. [_history as the embodiment of allegory, allegory as the interpretation of history; this tale resembles some of the latter passus of langland, an allegorical retelling of christian history._]

1043. the child __becomes a vision__ himself - he bears the likeness of his mother, so much that the father fears that it might be a hallucination - material vision.

1162. the conclusion is a triumphant confirmation of the allegorical reading of the tale - standing for the __conversion of england to christianity__. but the boethian meditation on happiness and providence is reiterated as well; one year after the meeting, king alla dies - because __happiness is unreliable__, ephemeral.

##The Epilogue

1190. the priest, called a __lollard__, loses his turn to the shipman, who wishes to tell a __bodily tale__. no time for sermons. the controversy was on __swearing__ [_again, the problem of divine law, here in its verbal implications_].
