##Ideas

- The physician's tale is the short, brutal tale of power and death; the pardoner's description and speech underlines his use of __relics__.

##The physician in the prologue

444. his description combines scientific knowledge drawn from classical authorities with __sorcery__ - the poet emphasizes the fact that the physician was well read, __except for the scriptures__. he had remedies for every patient, but he valued gold above all "cordial[s]." his virtue is learning, his sins are greed and maybe heresy. [_it is hard to decypher the connection between this portrait and the tale told by the character; perhaps it has something to do with the opportunities that classical tradition - and secular learning - might have of uncovering theological or moral teachings; perhaps it is a history without redemption precisely because it is told from the perspective of an erudite atheist, who shares the same problems of a pagan. wisdom without salvation._]

##The tale

71. the mode of romance is interwoven with __personifications of vision__, starting with __nature__: the figure interrupts the story about the knight and his daughter to explain, in a long __monologue__ [_one of the modes of vision_], her powers as a "vicaire general" of the highest maker (god). the daughter is exemplary for unprecedented beauty and virtuous chastity.

	- is there a heretic connotation in this digression - devised, again, by the physik? [_that is, is nature a pagan motive, is its praise the beginning of renaissance?_]

104. another digression, about the ways in which handmaids and parents should look after their daughters, as if they were precious goods - or lands - to maintain intact. the physik is adopting a __prescriptive tone__, as if he was __instructing a patient on his body__. [_and isn't this the focus of the whole fragment, perhaps? the body, whereas fragment two would be focusing on the soul?_]

148. as in fragment two, the story is a romance against which we see the __influence__ of higher forces on the material plane. here we have __envye__ and, again, the "feend," animating vicious desires in a "juge" who wants the daughter after having __seen__ her (not after having __heard__ about her, as customary). he adapts trickery instead of temptation. [_bodily senses._]

190. the tale now emphasizes two elements: the __authenticity of the story__ (attested by the latin names used in it - it is a documented episode), and the social role of the corrupt __juge__, who uses his powers against the knight and jis daughter - with a "__bille__" (a document). [_power is paper in latin antiquity. nobody can be redeemed when the scripture is false._]

212. __injustice__ of power - the knight loses his daughter to the judge, who has the authority to decide over her life - a __tyrant__. there is little __plot__ here, because there is no way to fight against the decisions of powerful men.
		
	- is a boethian reading possible here as well? with the __soul__, however beautiful and virtuous, being a __subject__ of the __dark forces of history__? [_maybe it works better with the daughter being the body, not the soul; the body in its state before the possibility of forgiveness, of christian redemption._]

	- or is this a __tale__ about __impotence__ against sin and evil? resignation against them.

286. the darkest possible ending - __everybody dies__. the knight beheads his daughter - after having left her time "to compleyne." the judge and the servant who helped him die, from suicide and hanging respectively. the knight is betrayed and killed while in exile. "the remnant were anhanged, moore and lesse." the final remarks are about the __unexpectedness of sin and death__, against which one should constantly take heed. __prescriptions by the irreligious physician__, again. why? [_in a way, if the story tries to exemplify the condition of humanity before or without christian redemption, all these prescriptions make little sense, because they lack the fundamental remedy for salvation, the relationship with jesus. is this lack the one that the pardoner will eventually address? problematic compensation, because the pardoner is evil; but an evil man in christianity is more likely to be saved than a virtuous one in heathendom._]

##The Pardoner in the prologue

611. the poet insists on __physical qualities__ - his melodious shrill __voice__, his long blond hair. the Pardoner seems characterized by __vanity__ - he keeps his hood "trussed up in his walet."

	- the features of his body and his voice are feminine; eventually we learn that "he were a geldyng or a mare" - a eunuch or a homosexual. ch. insists on the lack of a beard and on the high-pitched voice. physical traits - not psychological. [_the pardoner has the appearance of an effeminate man, but perhaps that is simply his body, and he is a heterosexual man from the standpoint of gender._]

706. the pardoner deals in pardons and relics; he keeps counterfeit relics in his sack, which he uses to trick poor people into giving him absurd quantities of money. [_false appearances, false miracles; think about the substituted letter in the man of law's tale._]

714. the conclusion is that the pardoner is greedy too - he uses his voice to collect more money from the parishioners during the "offertorie." his voice is pleasant deceit.

	- the whole description is based on the idea of profitable __seduction__ and __deception__. __guiles__.

##Introduction to the pardoner's tale

319. the first part of the introduction records the __hoost__'s reaction to the story; this __models__ the __reader's reaction__; __shock and compassion__ for the injustice endured by the characters of the story. the hoost even rephrases the moral that he has gained from it - that the gifts of __fortune and nature__ (boethian forces here) are ofter more dangerous than helpful. __pedagogy__ enacted: __affective__ reaction and __intellectual__ development, just like in boethius. [_the whole pilgrimage as a boethian - or langlandian - progression towards wisdom; the tales as the various interlocutors that make the witnesses - and the readers - understand better. metaphysical journey, physical journey; chaucer adapts the decameron to piers plowman, and he uses the stories to forward a moral agenda. the collection of stories is foreign (latin or italian), the pilgrimage is english._] the tale is then used as a __parable__, or __as a poem__ in one of the sections of _consolation_. we even find a reference to the teller's [_teller of the tale_] profession: more than a physician, for the hoost, he seems a "prelat." the hoost is then close to a __heart attack__, in his words; and the available medicine ("triacle") is a "draughte of moyste and corny ale." __effective teaching__? the pain can be relieved with a __drink__ or a "myrie tale." distractions.

328. the pardoner insists to have drinks and food as he starts his __happy tale__ - although the rest of the group asks him to focus on __teaching__ some "moral thyng."

	- contrast between the __dark moral parable__ told by the physik, and this cheerfulness.

##The pardoner's prologue

434. we discover more about the pardoner's activity; he admits to be especially greedy, but then he explains that he is fond of __preaching__ against it - he lives by this very contradiction. "radix malorum est cupiditas." the speech is, in itself, a __confession__ - an exposition of the character's unredeemed sinfulness. he quotes his own speech - used to collect money for __fake relics__ (sheep bones - almost __sorcery__).

462. the pardoner is admittedly a "__ful vicious man__"; but he can tell moral stories, used to get money from the poor. dissociation between the moral qualities of the narrator and those of the story he tells - the poet especially inists on this. [_and the story itself might become one of these fake relics, a witness of falsehood, a dangerous object of our reverence; besides, this introduction could falsify the entire moral trajectory of the pilgrimage - what if the stories we are telling do not actually advance our knowledge and our virtue? what if there is a conflict between them?_]

##The tale

578. a hilarious tale; the mode is that of __expansion__, literal and stylistic; from a __small__, circumscribed episode - a "compaignye" of depraved young sinners in "flaundres," we shift to a __homiletic__ condemnation of __gluttony__. a gluttonous text in itself, incorporating sources from any field - classical thinkers and exempla, the bible, and a satire of our everyday behavior. it is a __bodily digression__ - including an apostrophe to the "wombe" - where the refusal of carnality and consumption actually becomes its triumph. [_somehow analogous to what is happening in usk._] the pardoner seems especially fond of the spiced foods and exotic wines that he is attacking.

	- the decription of the smelly, foul phenomenology of gluttony is indeed hilarious.

660. the __climax__ of this sermon is a condamnation of __swearing__ where he actually swears - a sequence of funny oaths used to preach against them, but probably producing the opposite effect - __laughter__. the argumentation is faulty, the examples become less vivid and more obscure. is the pardoner getting drunk? [_the quintessential example of this paradox - how do we condemn the words that we must use to condemn? how can we be outside of this temporality, of this sinfulness, of language?_]

701. the actual tale seems to be about these sinners who, safe in the warm excesses of a tavern, learn about death killing hundreds of people - probably a reference to the __plague__ - and therefore decide to visit him, to kill him.

	- the premise could be the __unmaking__ of the previous tale - fixing its tragedy. [_true - fixing its tragedy after the history of christian sacrifice and redemption; the question being, what is sin like, now that we are no longer haunted by its inevitability, by the fact that we will never ever be redeemed?_]

709. the poet uses often the image of these sinners "tearing" the body of christ through their wicked conduct. a bodily image of sin for a bodily story about it.

767. the three sinners meet an __old man__ who wishes to die rather than stay old - perhaps a __personification__ (not explicit!) of __old age__. the man directs them to the "ook" where they shall find deeth. the story is almost a vision.

801. the old man actually directed them to a treasure of golden "floryns," a gift of __fortune__ which distracts them from their quest. the tale is now about the ways in which they could split the trasure - one of them is now clearly trying to trick the rest. using his speech for greed, like the pardoner. [_a deceiving tale, like a deceiving relic. false stories - false documents - are still possible._]

836. for greed (which derived from lechery, gluttony, and sloth) the two sinners left decide to murder the third one. sin leads to more sin. the parable seems to eventually incorporate the __entirety of human life__ - society is broken by the sins of the individual.

878. the third sinner decides to murder the other two with poison - prompted by the devil's influence. the moral is becoming clearer - a parable, but also a __vision of human life__ [_in time_] from youth, to old age, to death; all told in a vivid urban setting.

945. the tale turns into an __admonition__, and then into __a request to give donations__ for an absolution and for the enjoyment of the relics. the pardoner has even forgotten the frankness of his own prologue, where he clearly confessed the wicked purpose of his speeches. automatism, in a way - or obscure power of the tale itself, stronger than he?

955. the hoost is not persuaded; his reply is __gross scatology__ - testicles covered in shit are compared to the precious relics carried by the pardoner [_and to the story itself? is this equation still possible? has it ever been?_] ineffective method, then.

	- is chaucer, again, modelling the __reader's response__ through these sections?

	- in the conclusion, the knight protects the pardoner and makes the host kiss kim. bellator. [_the complementary components or society interact as it is espected by them - the bellatores defend the oratores, who exploit - or try to exploit - the laboratores. chaucer sympathy seems to go with the latter._]
