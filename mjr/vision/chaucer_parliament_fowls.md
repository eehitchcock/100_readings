#Geoffrey Chaucer, The Parliament of Fowls

##Introduction

- a dream vision with a slightly comical narrator, like book of the duchess and house of fame.

- introduction of the "__rime royal stanza__" - four beat couplet.

- about __1380__; there are some theories about the historical characters involved.

##Commentary

7. love is immediately the object of the exploration; and its consequences are immediately unknown (and unknowable). the author does not even know what his __affective reaction__ is when he is __intellectually__ engaged.

11. the experience of "__dede__" and the knowledge of "__bokes__" are juxtaposed.

84. here we find the summary of the book of scipio. the treatise, in macrobius' adaptation especially, does not discuss love, but a supposedly higher theological truth [_at a certain point lady philosophy becomes the divinity of love, and chaucer knows that, and chaucer seems to joke about that - the shift from boethius to guillaume and to dante. we are still looking for love in the wrong place - the books that would teach us about philosophy - it is like mixing divine contemplation with poetry._]; however, this is the book on which the poet focuses. is he satirizing precisely the overlapping, the moment when __philosophy__ becomes __love__? the fact that love is "dede," and philosophy bokes? [_in any case, this is the monological mode that is introduced in bothius' pedagogy as one of the methods of philosophy_]

126. here there is some intense elaboration of __visionary tropes__; the poet sees affrican - a historical person whose symbolical meaning is still hard to decypher, and this is clearly a __dream__, understood and explained in its psychological function. however, he decides to invoke venus, a deity, suspended between its __allegorical valence__ and its __religious power__.

	- notice, too, that this setting is reminiscent of the one in __roman de la rose__.

161. the writing placed on the two doors of the garden's gate are _meaningless_ for the poet - it has little power over him. __writing can be ineffective__. [_still not completely sure about the meaning of this observation; is this a meditation on the contrast between verbal and nonverbal? or that between signifier and signified, primary and secondary meaning?_]

176. the piece collects the recurrent themes and formal elements of __vision__ - including the __taxonomic mode__ of the list of trees, al used by men as implements or as symbols. notice that the highly literary moment follows scipio's invitation to __write__. this encyclopedic moment, which is apparently a triumph of __natural elements__, is in truth a highly __cultural__ one, dictated by human custom.

210. another motive, the __locus amoenus__ described in a pristine state, its highest embodiment.

	- it is a triumph of __sound__ and __music__ - of nonverbal means, contrasting with human expression. it is a human creation that is apparently foreign to humanity. [_another element that deserves attention - cultural artifacts that escape our control, and become unfamiliar._]

285. the experiment continues with __spatialization__ and the combination of __pagan deities__ - used allegorically - and __allegorical personifications__. the taxonomic principle of roman de la rose is present here too - an argument through proximity.

294. we also have a series of __exempla__ that are only __mentioned__, painted on the wall of the most __hidden__ chamber. these figures, examples of tragic love, are named but not introduced, thus creating a puzzling effect of suspension.

322. an explicit reference to __alain de lille__ here, when the poet sees nature in the garden where the whole dream started. nature is different from everything that has come before - it is a __deity__, an __entity__, but perhaps an __allegorical personification__ too. the main object of this literary experiment truly seems to be the __crisis__ of the __allegorical method__ - as if the poet was trying to show its contradictions, ultimately leading to what can no longer be known, or be signified.

	- the context is, however, that of the triumph of nature. noise and light. [_that is, the intensified light and natural sounds that the poet - dreamer - encounters as he approaches the place where nature is sitting; this is in contrast with the highly cultural (literary) mode of the discussion; the place where poetry is discussed is always a fictional wood, an arcadia._]

364. a new method of allegory - the birds acquire __human traits__ (personification?) and they are used to express __human meanings__. it is an expansion of the tree taxonomy.

	- the animals are presented according to their function and their meaning, like the trees. [_it is the violence of allegory in the making; we are using animals to make human meaning. these animals only exist for humans._]

490. the three eagles who are wooing the eagle queen - the beautiful eagle - all state the same thing; this moment stresses the rapid exhaustion of literary motives, and - somehow - of this unnatural move of delivery, where properties and actions are transferred onto entities that cannot bear them. the aristocratic section of the tale - repetitive and stiff - ends soon (aristocracy is here the predominance of the __secondary__, _higher_ meaning, the birds' speech).

595. the democratic mode - clearly happening in __time__, in a mortal temporality that is aware of its finiteness (of the value of each __atom__) - is compared to the __animal sounds__ uttered by these lower fowls. it is a clash of contrasting opinions that nevertheless __cannot be reconciled__ - __the primary meaning__ - reality - is so complex in its diversity that, without wider categories, it is impossible to produce meaning. to take decisions. the democratic mode is so __mimetic__ - temporal - so analytical - so, somehow, realistic, that its lack of generalization produces, again, __paralisis__.

679. the conclusion is another __suspension__ - the eagle cannot decide, and we are forced to wait for another year - a year of silence - before learning what her heart might say. right before the end, the birds sing a "__roundel__)," a form that is foreign - __french__ - adapted to this context. __knowledge is translation__. [_still unsure about the connection to the rest; what does this have to do with primary and secondary meaning? knowledge works between particular and general? knowledge is always akin to the loss of information that is inevitable in the process of translation?_]

699. in the final stanza the poet wakes up, ready to read more, and hoping to dream more - and more of the useful stuff. it is an ambiguous ending - does this mean that __no decision__ is eventually possible? or that the process is in the end, inevitable? [_and, moreover, what is the relationship here between conscious and unconcious learning, between what is learnt in books, what is learnt in deeds, and what is learnt in dreams? are dreams a mixture of the first two?_]
