##Ideas

- Form reflects both the ideas of misunderstanding (the same referent can be applied to multiple meanings); and temporality (the idea of unity in sequence - divine temporality and human temporality can overlap; and the idea of the single word - pearl, spot - as a device that allows us to _feel_ divine temporality).

##Commentary

12. what are the features of this pearl, then? small, round, smooth and precious. initially defined only by its physical qualities - which are supposedly immediate indicators of its worth. lost in a garden, like the innocence after the original sin, and compared to the precious stones "oute of oryent" [ekphrasis is always associated to the exotic - beautiful and strange].

24. a change in some of the elements that define the __referent__ (signifier) - now the pearl is an object of love - it brings comfort and sweetness, like a woman.

36. here the poet describes how the dirt over the pearl produced beauty as well, colorful flowers. because birth requires loss and death. history is the issue of sin.

60. the loss provokes grief and sleep - against which neither reason nor the scripture can help.

72. here the dream begins (but weren't we in a dream already?); his spirit flies towards god in a journey that crosses forests and mountains. nature here beats culture.

120. the natural landscape surrounding and composing the __locus amoenus__ is a mixture of _nature_ and _culture_ (artificial - mineral). it's the "adubbement" of this valley, where each pebble is a gem or a pearl, everything shines and glitters, and birds sing actual music.

132. the contemplation and the presence of __nature__ comforts the dreamer - it undoes his grief and his stress. fortune enters as an agent - an allegorical personification that dispenses happiness and sorrow to men. once they experience her assistance, men seek her. [not a true all. pers., though more of an actual entity - a _force of fatum_.]

144. the locus amoenus clearly becomes a sort of garden of eden. and beyond its streams, the poet imagines a __walled town__ - an inaccessible "mote merked." heaven?

180. the "more" section ends with the appearance of a beautiful "mayden" whom the dreamer recognizes and wishes to approach. desire pushes him forward, but fear __paralizes__ him.

	- _wisdom_ and _happiness_ (those dispensed by __fortune__, in boethian fashion) are one with __love__ for her.

240. the maiden is described as white and beautiful in the "perle" sectiion - she is a pearl covered in nothing but pearls. adornment and essence are __one__ here - a sort of contagion of the decoration onto its bearer. she eventually hails the dreamer.

252. we discover that the dreamer is a "jueler," and that he believes the maiden to be the lost __pearl__, transfigured into a _new shape_. he mourns the loss of the "juel." [remember that we reached the conclusion that the "jeueler" actually stands for the "poet" - that jewelry making and poetry making are eventually identified.

276. two details acquire new connotations: the garden is compared to "forser" and "kyste" - a chest -, perhaps the __material state__, the physical body, the primary meaning and the __signifier__ (compared to the elusive signified that is slowly becoming almost transcendent - the pearl); and the gentyl (or "kynde") jueler, which the dreamer might or might not be. who is a __jeweler__? an intellectual? a philosopher? a christian?

300. the jeweler wishes to cross the stream set between the two, but that is impossible.

	- the maiden insists on the fact that the dreamer __does not know__ what he is saying.

324. the maiden stresses __two errors__ in the dreamer's speech: that he relies on what he __sees__, and that he wishes to attain what he was not allowed to attain, and what chan be reached only after death [physical vision is deception, like in __cloud__].

360. a truly boethian section - its word is "deme," believe, the verb of __doxa__. the maiden asks the dreamer to stop complaining about what cannot be changed, and instead pray for __forgiveness__ and grace. a vivid description of mortal grief. [_the mortal grief experienced by the jeweler, his sense of mourning and loss._]

420. in the "blysse" section the theological motive becomes predominant - the maiden is clearly a divine creature. the pearl seems here to stand for a condition of __wholenesss__ - the jeweler was __one__ with the object of his love. that bliss was a pearl. [_remember that unity is a theme in boethius as well; that the description of the highest good - true happiness and god - begins with the acknowledgement that all happiness, all human desires, converge towards a single point, an atom - that atom being god itself. this is the pearl and its polysemous importance._]

444. __misunderstanding__. the dreamer _interprets_ the pearl but mistakenly - he thinks she's mary.

480. the mode is that of the __maieutic__ dialogue found in boethius. the poem plays with the convention and the vocabulary of __romance__ as well: the word repeated here is "cortayse." the dreamer, perplexed, asks - how could a creature so young attain the beatitude of older dead? [_the discourse exploits a political contradiction, and it has - perhaps - political implications; the contradiction is that the pearl maiden does not deserve her high rank; the implication is that politics and theology work differently - that we shouldn't expect our hierarchies to mirror the celestial ones._]

483. we discover that the "pearl" lived on our land no longer than "two yere."

492. the problem is that the "pearl" is a "quene," and not an inferior rank. __aristocracy__.

504. when confronted with the idea that the __divine providence__ (god itself) might be wrong, the pearl quotes a __parable from the gospel__. another pedagogical mode.

540. the parable is that of the vineyard (a social parable, about salaries, labor, and __time__ above all). the word repeated, fittingly, is "date."

600. the language of the parable is simple, and the vocabulary limited. the maiden then applies its __secondary meaning__ to her own circumstance - she deserves as much as the holiest old saint. the word here is "more" (like for the poet's wish). [_but the social meaning is still active; especially since the discussion began with the political comparison with aristocracy and its ranks._]

660. this section, whose word is "inough," the sufficient presence of __divine grace__ - mostly deals with __time__: old men are less likely to remain holy, because time systematically causes sin. then the story of redemption from the original sin: from jesus' wounds we received the blood and the water that wash away every original stain. that story as the __unmaking of history__. [_the section has a lot in common with the moment in Piers Plowman when we see the tree of ymago-dei shaken by old age; similarly, the exploration there too shifted from the individual level of old age vs. youth to the global level of history from original sin to the redemption brought by jesus._]

720. the section of "ryght" is a rational explanation of why pearl has been saved. [_that is, there was a legal justification for her redemption from damnation._]

732. we might be learning something new about the jeweler now: he might have sold all his gems for a single spotless pearl. what sort of man is he? he is a shifting signifier. [_definitively one of the most complex dreamer figures found so far - usually dreamers are identifiable with the historical person beyond the poet, or with disciples characterized by a set of distinguishable intellectual flaws. here we do not precisely where we should place him - we discover some details, but these are shifting. definitely one of the most problematic narrators in middle english - erratic discovery, problematic discovery._]

780. the signifier keeps shifting: the maiden refers to the realm of _heaven_, to the gem that she wears, and to herself as "pearl." the word is all these things. the bride of christ and his children (the lamb was her oyster, her womb). [_the relationship between container and contained is overlapping with signifier and signified, and with body and spirit - human and divine in the nature of christ - the lamb._]

840. the word repeated here is a place - jerusalem. the section opens and closes with john's apocalypse (his end of the world, with numberless brides for the lord, and the seven seals), and retells the passion of christ. in this single place the __entirety of time is made__. the word and the place have the same function - they are the __round atoms__ that contain the universe [_time and space, therefore, acquire the same boethian qualities of the pearl - they are the atomic highest goods where all human desires - all of the universe - converge - wholeness and uniqueness; jerusalem, the pearl, john's revelation - bringing all to a singular entity._]

864. the section of "lesse" is about a love that never diminishes - each chosen wife, marked by a white pearl born on her dress - shares the __infinite love of god__ with the rest - and this can never be reduced. they resemble an order of nuns. [_again, wholeness. interesting parallel with religious life._]

912. the tone becomes here fully apocalyptic - a mysterious vision of the most remote future. we perceive only part of the reason beyond this connection - the __mode__ is now poetical and __analogical__. the maiden paraphrases - for a couple of stanzas - what john would have said in apocalypse. the focus of this moment is sound - the song collectively sung during the end of the world.

	- a harmony that seems impossible to grasp for __human language__; a song that signifies the wholeness of christianity - god and the redeemed souls. [_the problem of language, then; language does not exist outside of time - like death or sex, what makes us like beasts. every expression of the divine - and especially of that wholeness of the divine that is everything at the same time in an atom of universe - is completely foreign to language, it is anti-language - because it is everything, and therefore it cannot be neither signified nor uttered by a discrete form - and because it is an instant so small - so infinitely small, an atom, that is no longer language; consider the obsession of "the cloud of unknowing" for monosyllabic words - almost non-words._]

972. the discussion shifts to the __kingdom of heaven__ - a "building" where the brides of christ might live. the dreamer wishes intensely to be brought there. we find here a strong interest in "place" - the problem of where. the poet __deduces__ the existence of paradise - a physical place, for him - heavenly jerusalem - from the descriptions of the maiden's blessed life. the section is "mote": city and stain.

985. the narrator insists on the sense of __sight__. vision of the __visible__ - what truly exists. this seems, again, a __romance__ - with __self-sufficient primary meaning__ [_crucial point; and this could be a mnemonic device, in EJ's words, an attempt to make the reader feel as if he or she had truly been in those place, an attempt to create a fictional memory of a place where we have never been, to make us remember valuable things. this is the sort of "realism" found here, in chaucer, and in dante._] - leafy branches, a valley, and a bright city. this is fantasy, not allegory. [_actually, it could be something different._]

1032. this section has "john" as its recurrent word, and it is a desctription of the holy city of __heavens__ through the stones that are found there. we understand why the poet is a jeweler (perhaps a metaphor for writing?): these are the gems of salvation. the stress is on color and briliance - a real feast for the eyes.

1092. the fine light of the heavenly city is the topic of this section, whose word is "more." [_again?_]

1152. the poet now becomes a new john: he sees the "delyt" of the last day, with the virgin brides marching through the city; there he sees a little maiden, in bliss. [_perhaps the true antecedent for every visionary text is the revelation of john._]

1176. the final section revolves around "paye"; as he attempts to cross the brook, the dreamer wakes up, and he can no longer access his beloved pearl, which is again lost.

1212. all that is left is longing, and the path of the __sacraments__ - hope for future "paye."
