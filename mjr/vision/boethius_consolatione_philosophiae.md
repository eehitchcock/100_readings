##Introduction

- born c. 476 C. E.; started as a __translator__ (had an excellent education).

- became a consul in 510 - this hampered his work as an __intellectual__ [politics v. contemplation].

- started working as a "master of offices" for __theoderic__ in 522; moved to the North of Italy. his job was diplomatic mediation.

- he was accused, fell in disgrace and was imprisoned. he died in ~526.

	- in __prison__ he wrote his most famous book.

- besides _consolation_, Boethius wrote on the sciences of the __quadrivium__ (music and arithmetic) and on __logic__; he also wrote on theological ideas.

##Commentary

###Book one: Sickness of History

- 1.1. the first word of the book is "__carmina__"; boethius starts with the __metrum__, and identifies himself as a __poet__. a former poet, who is now old and close to death.

- 1.1. the woman appears - her form is _shifting_ and hard to __decypher__; notice that the _reader_ himself would not be able to distinguish this shape.

- 1.7. boethius was surrounded by __muses__, a metaphor that becomes __visible__, acquires consistentcy; there are _different kinds of muses_.

- 2.1. [__imprisonment__ as a thematic and formal device] the second poem is constructed around the __contrast__ between _open_ and _closed_ spaces; the first are for _contemplation_ and research; the second for __brutality__ and darkness.

- 2. here we find the __motive__ of forgetfulness; B. does not recognize the visitor, who behaves like a __mother__ and a __lover__.

	- Boethius' sickness is called "__lethargum__ - comunem (illusarum mentium) morbum. she cleanses his dull eyes.

- 3. the third poem is simply an __allegorical__ description of dawn.

- 3.5. philosophy speaks like a __teacher__; like _socrates_; her speech is full of rhetorical questions, insistent and addressed to the reader too.

	- notice how agnition (_agnoresis_) is triggered by the _metrum_
	
	- the torn robe stands for the troubled recent history of wisdom.

- 4. a praise of the __serene man__ (serenus), who, like philosophy, resists the __adversities of history__. _serenity_ (granted by wisdom) is _strength_.

- 4. B. compares his present condition with the past. the parallel is always between __prison__ and __library__. the transition is a decision to enter politics.

	- the speech is the _full rage_ of history, unleashed against the subject.

	- the monologue is a sample of rhetorical virtuosity; three elements:

		1. the richness of rhetorical questions;

		2. the vocabulary of religion;

		3. the anonymous antagonists (creating a sense of __fatality__ - history as an obscure natural element).

- 5. A hymn dedicated to the __creator of the universe__; "stelliferi conditor orbis." it is a poem that juxtaposes the __perfect astronomical order__ of the cosmos with the __instability of fortune__. it eventually becomes a _prayer_.

- 5. here we have a dicsussion of __exile__ as a metaphorical state. boethius' true misery, for philosophy, is psychological and intellectual; his "__mentis__".

- 6. a poetical elaboration of the "_there will be time_" motive; mankind has to __comply__.

- 6. now philosophy __examines__ boethius' beliefs: as a _teacher_ (one of her personalities), she interrogates him. boethius believes that _there is a god who governs the world_. he simply does not know __how__ god does so - that is his __flaw__.

	- he has also forgotten __what man__ is.

- 7. this __metrum__ has a completely different _form_ - short lines (fives syllabes - feet?); it is a metaphorical description of boethius' mental dullness, compared to a cloudy sky.

###Book two: Fortune and Change

- 1. fortune is a __monster__, even when she assists you; philosophy invokes, as a soothing remedy, __rhetoric and music__ ("laris nostra vernacula" - handmaid in my house). philosophy tries to prove that fortune has never changed - her very existence is unpredictability, unreliability. __fortune never stops changing.__

- 1. a short poem, with very long lines; it describes fortune as a _cruel mistress_.

- 2. here philosophy starts speaking as fortune - somehow, momentarily __becomes fortune__.

	- fortune is a new _maternal figure_ here - a substitute for nature - or an assistant to nature. "cum te matris utero natura produxit" - after nature propmted your birth, you have become entirely subject to fortune's will.

	- the image of the __wheel__ is introduced here - incessant and inevitable, like a _natural element_. like a storm or an ebb, fortune should not be blamed.

- 2. a different metre (again): B. (the writer) experiments with poetical genres. this one alternates __long__ and __short__ lines. the theme is greed - man is insatiable.

	- the poem is still part of fortune's speech: she's the one who uses music and rhetoric.

- 3. rhetoric and music are only __palliative__ remedies; philosophy will later provide B. with a __real cure__. here she tries to convince him that he has been __fortunate__ and happy.

	- a __single happy memory__ of his sons, praised. __time__ is already a central motive.

- 3. __change is the single unchangeable__ condition of what is in the universe; "ut constet genitum nihil" - that nothing created holds still. a poem about change.

- 4. philosophy reminds b. of all the things that ought to make him feel still happy and fortunate; the first is the life of his relatives. real happiness, nevertheless, is inside the __self__ - it does not depend on material circumstances (it is __immortal__ and stable).

- 4. a new poem where fortune and material circumstances are compared to natural elements.

- 5. pedagogical premise: boethius can be cured (instructed, enlightened) only little by little. here philosophy is less rhetorical and more __logical__ (she reasons); she starts by explaining why material riches are actually worth very little.

	- there is something surprising in the way that philosophy insists on the dichotomy between __animate__ and __inanimate__. to __be__ (animate) is better than to __have__ (inanimate).

- 5. a praise of a former age (prior aetas), when man lived with simplicity.

- 6. here philosophy confutes the worth of secular power - it is __false power__.
	
	- at times b. is capable of surprisingly __materialistic__ twists - with a __modern__ lucidity in treating the human condition. here he asks - isn't secular power among men comparable to the irrational idea of a mouse domineering his peers?

	- in the end, power over other men is a __fiction__; fortune's gifts are bad for you.

- 6. a poem about nero's menness, an example of the __badness__ of _power_. the language is especially cruel and bloody. this functions as _evidence_ for the __prose__.

- 7. philosophy now explains that __fame__ too is worth little; she tries to describe how infinitely small the planet earth is; fame is always limited in both __time__ and __space__. great men, she concludes, never mind other people's opinion.

- 7. this poem reiterates the argument of the prose, and then turns into an __ubi sunt__ of former famous men. not evidence, but repetition.

- 8. philosophy's last claim about B.'s happiness: bad fortune is more sincere, more enlightening, more reliable than good fortune (deceptive).

- 8. and here the poem introduces a __new motive__: "__amor__" (love) is the force that regulates and holds the universe together. without love, the universe would be chaos. but mankind is capable of acting outside of its bonds.

###Book three: Happiness and the Highest Good

- 1. the objective of the exploration is now declared to be "true happiness" ("__veram felicitatem__"). the function of poetry is to make bitter remedies (degustata) sweeter.

	- the problem of this pedagogical approach is not _intellectual capacity_, but __disposition__ (mentis habitum). poetry changes (or improves?) an _affective habit_.

- 1. a short poem about happiness (pleasure), made more intense after sufference/falsity.

- 2. the description of the "summum bonorum"; the highest good - the one good that replaces (that fulfills) every aspiration and every wish. every man wishes the __same good__, but few men know what it is, and even fewer know how to reach it, like __drunkards headed home__.

- 2. a gorgeous poem about __return__; three large metaphors: a captive lion, a captive bird, a bent bough. they will all return to their __origin__, if freed from their prison, if they are shown what is the nature of their wish. man's aspiration to happiness is an __instinct__ [again the idea of __imprisonment__].

	- the poem uses _enjambement_ as a way of expressing this persistent want - incompleteness.

- 3. man is distracted from true happiness by the pursuit of material riches; this is a dialogue in a sort of _maieutic_ fashion (or socratic/platonic). greed is __misleading__.

- 3. a short (six lines) poem (epigram?) about the vanity of wordly riches; almost a _gnome_.

- 4. again, an explanation about the vanity of political positions; this section partially reitrerates the contents of _book iii_. the tone and the format has changed, however: now a __dialogue__.

- 4. an example of vain political powers: those accorded by nero (again). another short poem.

- 5. here philosophy describes the vanity of power; she add __evidence__ and __similes__ (e.g.: damocles' sword).

- 5. another short poem to break the argument - this time about power's powerlessness against fear.

- 6. the prose opens with a quotation from euripides; in greek, about __doxa__. who could understand this? the section discussed fame and nobility as not worthy of real praise.

- 6. a short poem, with really long lines. the theme, surprisingly duscibbected from the preceding prose - is __god__ - the true progenitor of every man, noble or not.

- 7. now philosophy criticizes every pleasure - including __procreation__; having children is a source of unhappiness, not joy. here the _intellectuall remedy_ has become truly harsh.

- 7. now the __honey image__ is reverted; honey hides the __bee's sting__. pleasure (poetry?) is dangerous.

- 8. more bitterness (the proses have become _shorter and shorter_): beauty is always only a matter of _misconception_; what is beautiful can become ugly when seen from a distance.

	- B. uses abundant metaphors from __vision and perspective__. see things differently.

- 8. a longer poem, against ignorance; it compares happiness with natural resources.

- 9. a new dialogue on true happiness. the human mistake (in perspective?) is to __divide what is one__. there is one good - combining them all: wealth, power, fame. a prayer is now needed.

- 9. an invocation and a hymn - a religious power is necessary in order to proceed with the argument (this is the function of this poem). we find __theological notions__ on god's nature here.

- 10. a dialogue on the highest good; it starts with the neoplatonic assumption about the world as a __constant degradation__ of a _single, perfect origin_ (core?). this is __god__.

	- beatitude is the participation of the single human to god's essence; happiness is man becoming a god.

	- the argument becomes strictly logical (an extended syllogism): every man seeks god.

- 10. a praise of the highest good - superior to every earthly pleasure, never misleading.

- 11. the one and the good are the same. the highest good is the one good. another tight argument: unity is life; animals seek life, and therefore unity. b. watches __nature__ and __instinct__.

- 11. this poem elaborates a corollary claim: truth is within the self, and one should __remember__ it.

- 12. one move that could be analyzed further: b. often admits having an __idea__ about how philosophy's questions (of his own doubts) could be answered or solved; but, although he might already be able to perceive hazily this new truth, he still asks for an __explicit clarification__ from philosophy. she will make things clearer. what is this need? a need for disciplined thought? for writing?

	- b. is the one who describes his creed - his faith in god - not philosophy.

	- also notice how this confident faith coincides with a knowledge of the __natural world__. god is the order immanent in nature, the unity underlying its diversity.

	- the argument comforts b.; and, through __sheer reason__, philosophy confutes the existence of evil.

	- the passage ends with a greek quote from parmenides; describing the neoplatonic cosmos.

- 12. a poem about __orpheus__, used as a conclusive parable: now that you know, _do not turn back_.
	
	- orpheus becomes the __thinker__ that overcomes death - through his __song__.

###Book four: Evil and Misunderstanding

- 1. the crucial question now: _what is the source of evil?_ the answer: evil is a fiction.

- 1. the poem imagines a flight beyond earth's atmosphere - the __celestial homeland__.

	- this is reasoning and poetry becoming the means to achieve a divine vision.

- 2. a dialogue - _maieutic_ approach to what is known and what is experienced. this is of course a model for the __reader's response__. at a certain point b. anticipates the course of the reasoning - the writing tries to restitute the _freshness and excitement of rational discoveries_.

	- we have here the notion of evil as unnatural, as a defect - evil people do not choose, they are __forced by their weakness__ to behave badly. evil is non-being.

- 2. a small poetic vision, unveiling the most powerful of tyrants: he's secretly oppressed by vices.

	- __vision__ is here an ulterior intellectual instrument, and a pedagogical tool.

- 3. the mode is here _expository_ (monologue), not _maieutic_ (dialogue). ph. distinguishes between the ultimate prize - the highest good - and the deceptive partial goals - material pursuits. men who indulge in earthly pleasures or vices become __beasts__ - they renounce their nature.

	- "ita fit ut qui probitate deserta homo esse desierit [...] vertatur in belvam."

- 3. the poem evokes circe's transformation of ulysses' crew; but it emphasizes a difference: she changed the body, not the soul; vices change the soul, not the body. poetry as contrast.

- 4. another dialogical piece; the evil are miserable and should be pitied - especially when they succeed. the conclusion of this section discussed some legal implications, advocating for a sort of _political change_ in the perception of the defendants. moving and compelling.

- 4. the poem reiterates the idea of __mercy__, and it praises _noviolence_; avoid war and punishment.

- 5. b. now exposes with lucidity the injustice of his contemporaries. the world appears to him _chaotic and casual_. philosophy has to persuade him of a __good ruler__.

- 5. this poem introduces the answer, without fully clarifying its consequences: it is just a __comparison__ - perhaps an allegory? we look at the consequences of astronomical motions, without perceiving their causes - so that they look surprising to us, puzzling.

- 6. this (theology) is the hardest issue; __reason__ has to light it like a fire. philosophy announces a formal change: she will no longer employ poetry - only an __organic argument__ - "ordine contexo rationes" (the consistency of form and content is among the strongest artistic premises of this work). she first introduces the difference between __providentia__ (providence) and __fatum__ (fate): it is a problem of __perspecitve__. the terms refer to the _single divine intelligence_, perceived within (fatum) and outside of time.

	- providence is the __unity__ - the sole origin - of the multiplicity happening in time.

	- providence and fate interact like the circles of the neoplatonic universe.

	- this passage - descriptive, expositive - is probably the densest so far (dante's paradiso).

	- the core is individual (singular) and immutable - stable; the rest is __moving in time__.

	- to the dim-witted, distant human, divine order appears like complete confusion.

- 6. a restorative poem, to make the journey's labor lighter. it is a __vision__ of the divine order, beyond the chaotic circles of the material universe. there one finds _stability_ and _balance_ - invisible in the world of time. _god makes circularity_.

	- (the circle is the way in which linear time becomes unity, and the world is ordered.)

- 7. here, in acorollary to the previous point, we see the return of the _dialogic mode_.

	- the point is that _every fortune_ is good, and that virtue (virtus) is __acceptance__.

- 7. three exempla - the last, hercules, being the most extended and powerful - to prove that struggles are often rewarded. "superata tellus | sidera donat" heracles had the sky (on his back) as a prize. notice how _sidera_ here has a christian undertone, although latent.

###Book five: Free Will and Eternity

- 1. now b. asks for a definition of __chance__ ("casus"): the digression is prompted by his curiosity. this is another _pedagogical mode_. her first statement is that casus does not exist - everything is __causa__ - ordered by god.

	- noticeable how philosophy calls thinkers with an endearing possessive adjective - here "meus aristoteles."

	- here we find the famous example of the treasure found by the farmer - not __casus__, but higher __causa__.

- 1. a small exemplary poem - or perhaps a small _allegory_ - where fortune's accidents - what we call casus - are compared to the geology of iraq, where two rivers part ways.

- 2. the question of __free will__: how does it exist alongside providence? it does, inevitably.

- 2. a small poetic comparison between the sun (phoebus) and god: only the latter's light penetrates all.

- 3. the exposition becomes denser: how is free will possible, if god has _ordained everything_? this long, _intricate_ section is perhaps boethius' longest _direct speech_ (the dreamer); he tries to argue _against_ philosophy for the __contradiction__ between _omniscience_ and _free will_; god's knowledge has to be certain, and this certainty impedes will.

- 3. this lively poem (octosyllabic?), full of rhetorical questions - or maybe actual questions - complements boethius' speech like a real song, a lyrical piece about the sadness of not knowing - _or of not remembering_ - what one wishes to know.

- 4. philosophy's answer contrasts _human dynamism_ with _divine simplicity_. it is another exposition - but this time it works through __parallels__ (or comparisons) that evoke similes and allegory - they equate the difference in perspective between _god_ and _man_ to __other differences__ found in the universe - touch and sight, sense and intelligence. the method is __analogy__ and juxtaposition - not logic.

- 4. this longer poem (whose lines are shorter) is a confutation of the _tabula rasa_ theory found in stoic philosophy. the point is that the __human mind__ is an active faculty.

	- this is the quintessential example of boethius' _poetry as a work of philosophy_.

- 5. the exposition explores the consequences of the previous point - divine intelligence occupies the highest rank of animal faculties (more than sense, imagination, and reason). the method is again more analogical than logic - more _faith_ than reason.

- 5. a shorter poem with very long ines (fourteen feet - an alexandrine): it is about the __special condition__ of man, who - only among the _animals_ - keeps his head high with reason.

	- this section is based on the dichotomy between human and animal, used to grasp the divine.

- 6. the last chapter - a prose about the __divine nature__. the crucial problem is __time__ - understanding god's __eternity__. eternity is not simply lasting forever _in time_ - it is the ability to comprehend all time at once. __time is a degradation of eternity.__

	- "ex immobilitate deficit in motum, ex simplicitate presentiae decrescit in infinitam futuri ac praeteriti quantitatem."

	- the world is perpetuum; god is aeternum.

	- god's eternity is simple present - eternal present - __fixity__.

	- the ending is __pure philosophy__.

	- there are two orders of necessity; but for god all is one. the ending, addressed to a _second person plural_, as an __impereative__ in a sermon (_omiletic_), describes __god's eye__, seeing all.

##Conclusive thoughts

1. The structure of the volume:

	1. Book one: Boethius' double misery. His _forgetfulness_ and his physical _imprisonment_.
	
	2. Book two: fortune and material goods are deceiving; they are unstable and ephemeral.

	3. Book three: the highest good is one, and every man seeks it; it is God.

	4. Book four: the origin of evil; the problem of perspective, between unfathomable _providentia_ and deceiving _fatum_.

	5. Book five: free will and eternity.

2. A pedagogical manual, where form and content are attentively distributed in order to achieve clarity and effectiveness. The learner has to access new ideas only when he or she is ready for them.

3. The argumentative instruments employed are also different, from monologic exposition, to maieutic dialogue, from poetic exempla, to tight theological (or philosophical) argument. Similarly, Boethius contemplates different objects according to his purpose: the natural world from a scientific perspective, or the domain of ideas from a purely metaphysical one.
