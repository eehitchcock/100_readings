##The second nun in the prologue

164. we know very little about herl she is the prioress' "chapleyne," and walks with three priests.
	
	- the prioress, as a reinder, is frivolous and simple; she is vane, and sentimental.

##The prologue of the second nun's tale

28. we have no narrative introduction for this tale; only this prologue, where the nun describes her project: she will tell the life of __seint cecilie__, "mayde and martyr," whith the purpose of distancing her listeners from the __mortal vice of sleuthe__.

	- the metre is rime royale. the issue seems topical: vita __activa__ and __contemplativa__.

119. the rest of the prologue seems equally topical. we have an invocation to mary that starts with a close paraphrasis of dante; then we find an etymology of cecilia's name; that is broken into several possible ways, all accepted by the poet. the options that we have to interpret this __name__ correspond to her many virtues. [_you can think about will's many names in piers plowman._]

168. a wonderful opening. chaucer uses hagiography as a solemn genre, hieratic and precious; the gestures and the words flow slowly, the metre is long and it never breaks into enjambement (or into irregular lines). the maiden has to persuade her husband that she will stay a virgin, and she describes the - false? - protection of an angel. a miracolous intervention that is - so far - only __fiction__. is it faith?

	- what is the connection between __seeing__ and __believing__, if we consider faith?

	- the husband wants to to see the angel, like the characters in the __york gospel__ - like joseph. [_a good take on the genre of dream vision, then; the alternation between different levels of perception, and the problem of their connection to faith._]

241. cecilia sends her husband to urban, so that he might convert himself. he does; and afterwards he enters the realm of __vision__. he is now able to see the angel that follows cecilia; a __third person narration__ of a vision. something extraordinary for this genre.

	- the instrument of conversion is "a book with lettre of gold in honde" - as if the husband entered the world of the book as a portal.

266. the husband's brother cannot see, but only __smell__ the miracolous __flower crowns__; the brother explains that true __vision__ is __reality__, not dream, because "in dremes [...] han we be | unto this tyme." the twist to the genre is truly the way in which we adopt the __visionary__ perspective of a character described in the third person singular. we might share his new sight.

329. after a quotation from saint ambrose, translated into the middle english rime royale and discussing the conversion of both the husband and the brother [_it is a sort of documentary source_], we discover that the brother refuses to be converted for fear of being burned as a heretic. two contrasting speeches.

	- tiburce is eventually convinced by __theological truths__ explained to him by cecilia; she starts with trinity. after his conversion, he "every day saugh in tyme and space | the angel of god."

	- again, __knowledge__ (here the canonical teaching by cecilia [_founded on the scriptures and on theological authorities, like augustine, who often discussed the trinity_] is the way to conversion. [_cecilia becomes the sort of teacher found in visionary texts; she is the interlocutor of the dreamer, the guide; she is perhaps also a double for the teller of the story, the mysterious second nun who is instructing her audience._]

413. miracle and tragedy, the saint is able to form a group of converted christians around her; but they are betrayed and slaughtered.

	- their souls are seen ascending towards heaven.

511. the dialogue between cecilia and her accuser follows the mode of the __maieutic__ dialogue found in other dream visions, but also the holy trials of the gospels. the pattern remains the same - the skeptical learner, the enlightened leader. here cecilia has become a __personification__ of theological wisdom (like pearl or beatrice); she questions the accuser's authority and his true power. one of the problems is the conflict between earthly __senses__ (vision especially) and the higher awareness granted by divine truth. [_the whole tale, therefore, could be read as a reported dream vision, a third person dream vision._]

553. the ending is bloody; placed in a burning bath, the saint dies slowly of the wounds inflicted onto her by her tormentors. her house eventually becomes a __church__. like christ in the york cycle, she becomes a __sign__, a _signifier_, through her body and silence.

##The canon yeoman in the prologue

- there are neither canon nor his yeoman in the general prologue. not useful.

##The canon yeoman's prologue

614. the canon and his yeoman join the company only now. their description is purely __physical__; some details about their clothing, but the real focus is on the __sweat__, frothy and unstoppable, on their faces and their horses. two __exhausted bodies__.

	- the first dialogue is with the yeoman, the worker, who introduces his master.

719. a canon is an __alchemist__; the yeoman is a servant and an apprentice. the master lets him speak for him; he starts by praising the profession, but soon the host manages to make him confess; they do not know the science yet. alchemy is described as a __physical quest__; pale faces, metals, poverty and sweat. __labor of illumination__. [_the contrast between this tale and the previous one seems based on the juxtaposition of two levels of vision and intellectual research; the pure vision of contemplation and pure logic, as in cecilia, and the complete reliance on materiality, handled and exhausted, seen here._]

##The canon yeoman's tale

818. the opening of the tale is a long list of __matters__ - the elements and ingredients, of every sort, that have been employed for the alchemical research. it is a tale of __consumption and exhaustion__; things used to achieve the higher goal. this material focus reminds us of the sweat and froth of the opening. __labor and matter__.

930. a long description of the labor itself - it is a sort of material substitute of an intellectual method - it is an __experimental__ method, in a way. chaucer seems to acknowledge this, by having the yeoman expose his knowledge of astrology and the elements. and the description of these characters' devotion reveals a genuine motivation - they believe in what they are doing, they sacrifice everything for their research. they grow poor and attract the people's scorn. the description of the pot exploding involves the __devil__. some of these lists of matters and stones may refer to the __tradition of lapidaries and bestiaries__.

	- words become items; it is also an exposition similar to saint cecilie's teachings.

971. the experiments constantly fail; the matter is sweeped and reused. a cycle that might be endless; a group of investors that keep __hoping__. their direct speeches about the possible causes for the failure of the experiment indicate a __vivid collective effort__.

1073. the actual tale is about a priest and a canon. the canon is an expert __manipulator__ - he can use his words very well for fiendish purposes. the tale becomes a __mirror__ of the previous one - __conversion__ to christianity, and __conversion__ out of it. __greed and rhetoric__.

1175. as the canon practices his tricks to beguile the priest, we learn that he is a sort of fiend from another world. "on his falsehede fayn wolde i me wreke, | if i wiste how, but he is heere and there; | he is sovariaunt, he abit nowhere." __embodied evil__ [_the sort of agent operating in history that we have seen in other dream visions and allegorical personifications._]

1278. with the number of experiments, it increases the priest's happiness, excitement and __hope__ [_strong sense of expectation; in a way, it is a wish to witness the supernatural, an anxiety to experience something transcendent or divine._] as well. the description of the __art__ has changed from the first part. now it is just a series of __tricks__, done with malevolence and without any curiosity. it is also a lesson on mistrusting appearances and senses (the opposite from the nun's tale, about the __true vision__ of theology). __deception__.

1374. the final gladness experienced by the priest makes him comparable to a bird in spring, to a lady in love, to a knight in a romance. he loses his __identity__ and perhaps his __dignity__. no longer recognizable as a man of religion. he is now as covetous as the rest of society. he buys the formula for forty pounds.

1481. the conclusion is a long __explicit moral__ - about greed caused by need and about the neverending hope that drives men to blindness.

	- the tale had a strong sense of its __consistent imagery__ - the fire, the sweat, the metal [_although prof. johnson pointed out that the versification is especially faulty here; the couplets are highly irregular compared to the rest of the tales, and especially to the perfect form of the second nun's one._]

	- there is a contrast between __sensorial__ and __intellectual__ blindness.

	- eventually, the yeoman describes some of the hermetic vocabulary employed by the alchemists. it is conveived to be solely understood and used by them [_this conclusive digression is also another way in which the form of this tale can be considered broken and faulty_].

	- the quest is cryptic because the object can only be granted by the higher virtue of god; the ending identifies the stoon with a __distant theological truth__; theology and alchemy might work similarly [_this is perhaps the most disconcerting implication of this pairing, or the most clever; as boethius has taught us, humans all llok for the same object - the highest good; only, they use different paths to get there, some of which are incorrect_].
