#The Testament of Love by Thomas Usk

##Introduction

- we have no ms. for ToL; the first edition is a printed version from 1532 (nearly 150 years after usk's death). the edition that we have is __heavily corrupt__.

	- we also have, right now, a linguistic construction - the idea of middle english that the renaissance had is the language used for this edition [by __r. allen shoack__, from the university of florida].

- the teams edition acknowledges this corruption and therefore it provides all of its incoherence.

- usk entered politics in the 1380s, sided with the wrong party, and was sentenced in 1388.

- the editor of this edition thinks that the __inventive imagery__ of tol is its most interesting feature - it is a __challenging__ poetical mode, demanding for the reader.

	- the pearl should be the quintessential image for usk, polysemous and intricate.

- the initial letters of each chapter form a long acrostic - "margarete of virtw have merci on thin usk." the pearl is the central image from the beginning

##Comment

###Prologue

9. the opening contrasts the colorful verses of other poems with the __plain, rough prose__ that usk intends to write here. he will just write the truth, colorless. [_this truly looks like a lie; but perhaps it is simply a justification of prose; usk considers prose the only mode capable of dealing with the higher truths expounded by love._]

27. here we find a contrast between what is possible to write in french and latin and what can be done in english. these languages have different lexica and different traditions. so that one should stick to what one's language allows - __the english mode__. [_usk's work is indeed one of adaptation and translation; of incorporation of foreing truths into the english canon and the english form._]

59. __boethian elements__: all men aspire to the love and knowledge of god; again the __instinctive drive__ towards __happiness and divinity__. then, a writer should be known for his work as a thinker; usk's thoughts will be about __love__, hence the title. usk considers himself a humble follower of greater thinkers [_boethius; the work is clearly a compilation at this stage._]

90. we have here an example of the __elaborate imagery - at times inconsistent__ - used by usk - from the __hunt__, to the __banquet__, to the __pilgrimage__, to the __ocean__. many images used to express the validity of authority on tradition, starting with boethius.

	- the __genre__ [_that of vision_] has become a __literary convention__, and the stage for a __discussion of sources__ [_a place where the mind can freely adapt different sources, both philosophical and literary._]

###Book 1

85. a long complaint addressed - apparently - to a beloved woman named "__margaryte__," to whom the writer associates __all happiness and fortune__, in a manner that resembles both boethius' allegory and dante's history. the mode seems to be be the same __shifting signifier__ that we found in _pearl_. we learn that the man has been imprisoned and that he fell in disgrace. __vagueness__ [_in the treatment of history; as if even his own life had become part of a literary convention. close affinities with margery kempe_].

110. usk swiftly compares his experience with that of the __angels__ who see god. there seems to be a __dense stratification__ of theological and philosophical layers.

	- the idea is that of __accumulation__ - episodes have assimilated __multiple readings and interpretations__ throughout time; usk tires to __compile__ them all. the first level of meaning is history itself, his biographical background.

138. there truly seems to be a conscious element of __literary playfulness__ here; the passage is a __paraphrasis__, almost a translation of boethius, which culminates, however, with a __surprise__: usk failed to recognize love, not philosophy.

	- consider, too, that love is here a woman; in latin and in dante it's usually male.

222. __unusual images__; as the editor says, usk is always looking for the new and the unconventional in his imagery. here his __lack of constancy__ - not actual, only hypothetical - is compared to an obscure game of "__racquets__." the mode is that of the __maieutic__ dialogue found in boethius; love first reminded the dreamer of her __influence__ in history, her virtuousness and religious importance; then we have an __apologia__ and the purpose of them meeting - "to voyde the webbes of thyne eyen." [_replacement; translation but also adaptation, boethius is becoming part of usk's life, and usk is adding all his readings to boethius, and all his symbols to boethius; he is transforming boethius into himself. therefore, when he eventually incorporates lady love into himself, usk is actually proving that this has been the mode - that the vision is always the encounter with a textual tradition, and that he has been successful in incorporating himself into this tradition, and this tradition into himself._]

241. love wants to allow usk to write a __useful__ book about her, to make her ideas known. like with chaucer, the project and the setting are immediately __literary__ - here explosively so.

311. asked about the reason of his current distress, usk tells the story of his love through an incredibly __dense and articulate allegory__ - he was in a wood, he got lost [_and chased by wild animals, like in dante_], found the sea and four ships, almost drowned, and eventually saw an __oyster__ and the beautiful __pearl__ contained inside. the __images are literary__, and the connections between them are intricate and vivid, but not by necessity disorienting.

	- the choice of prose is perhaps motivated by a need for __stylistic freedom__ between genres and sources.

356. and here we return to the boethian root - the joy of this meeting is now marred by the sadness of its loss. the dreamer is now alone, and left to captivity and mourning.

413. after the dreamer's teary complaint, love scolds him bitterly - causing him to grow red with __shame__ [_boethius and chaucer (and dante), affective reaction registered by the dreamer, transmitted to the reader_] - and then __comforts him__. affective reactions in the dreamer, perhaps with the purpose of modelling the reader's reactions. some of love's speech is in __indirect discourse__: is usk acknowledging his incapacity for a highly poetic soothing discourse? [_incapacity for poetry, therefore incapacity for explicit consolation, which can only be reported indirectly?_] the teaching remains the same: love can save you.

508. a discussion about __specificity and generalization__, concerning the methodological validity of examples, becomes [_develops into, has as a consequence_] an example itself, about __contemplativa__ and __activa__. the two paths to good behavior are reinterpreted in boethian terms: earthly and celestial pursuits.

	- love is thus in contrast with __secular fame and power__; love is a higher, nobler goal.

654. here we have the beginning of the __apologetic__ confession, a narration of the __historical circumstances__ that led the writer to this sad imprisonment. the story involves wicked gossip, false fame, and envy. in the conclusion, usk explains that this is one of the purposes of his writing - to record the __truth__ [_in the sense of the historical truth, his "version" of how things went, so that his fame can be restored for posterity on earth_] (very different from boethius here).

727. a __consolation__; the two characters discuss false and true voices, and the deceiving value of __fame__. love's conclusion is that only less virtuous men will believe usk's infamy [_margarete will remain on his side, she would never believe these false voices_].

841. a different sort of consolation; love reminds him that his story and his city [_london is named many times in this section._], his bodily existence confined in __time__, is __infinitely small__ when compared to divine beatitude.

	- the mode is a sequence of __images and exempla__; the mold is always boethian. small london.

884. the __intellectual faculties of mankind__, and his theological virtues, are praised in ways that seem to mimic _usk's poetical inclinations_: man has a __protean soul__, capable of __elevation and multiple contemplation__; shifting, like his images. [_here is one of the crucial formal declarations, then; usk's imagery is shifting and inconsistent because the human soul is shifting and inconsistent._]

934. the image of the __knot__ is introduced to describe the __unbreakable bond__ between the author and his beloved margarite. the same image seems to stand for the __connection between the soul and god__, following the model of the _song of songs_.

1025. a section that resembles a close paraphrasis of boethius, about the unreliability of fortune and the danger of earthly happiness. it is, in a way, as if the prose described usk's encounter with b. - a secondary source, a mediator.

###Book 2

96. the preface to this book completely identifies __love__ with __happiness and fortune__. and i guess that here we might find one of the main contradictions of the parallel - love is both __material and transcendent happiness__ - both an earthly and a divine reward. the pearl margarite embodies the __ambivalence of many names__ [_ambiguous signifier_].

97. a proof of the fact that the book might actually describe usk's encounter with boethius' text, and not with a personification of its knowledge: __love sings in latin__; he translates [_and he transcribes into prose; the opposite of what chaucer does in the man of law tale - fr. 2_].

225. again the mixture of __material and transcendent__; the conventional grammatical discussion of gender - from alain - becomes a praise of the feminine, and then of women [_actual women - from abstraction to concreteness._]

406. a paraphrasis of some boethian arguments, from the collective search for the highest good, pure happiness, to the refusal of a false search - not oriented towards it. __translation__.

	- the maieutic mode is preserved as well; only some terms have changed - __love__.

619. the knot is discussed in detail here; it is perhaps the second most significant __deviation from the original consolatione__, besides the pearl. its true meaning remains ambiguous - it is the object of our desire, or it is our relationship with it [_either an object or a connection to an object_]. it is inside of us [_like dame love at the end of the book_].

1069. these ideas are those of boethius, but the mode is persistently __metaphorical__ (not just allegorical) - notions that become objects, the transcendent that becomes tangible - and that is described by it, as if usk had no control over his images.

	- the contradiction is especially striking when usk's purpose is that of refusing the material plane.

###Book 3

574. as the book progresses, the form of the dialogue becomes more predominant, and __lively__ [_almost dramatic_].

801. at the core of the final section is a similitude that compares love to a __tree__, like trinity [_in piers plowman_].

914. the dreamer wakes up as lady love enters his chest; she is now part of him. the conclusion is an exposition in his own voice, explaining again the purpose of the book [_literary tradition; mutual incorporation of the book within himself, himself within the book_].
