##Ideas

- The eagle might well be a reference to the teacher/learner motif often found in this tradition.

- It is possible that the two parts of the third book correspond to two temporalities; the fixedness of literary past, and the bustle of the urban present.

##Introduction

- __octosyllabic couplets__, and a __dream vision__ like _book of the duchess_.

- italian influence - not just dante but __boccaccio__ as well.

- the customary date for it is __1379-1380__.

##Book 1

65. the introduction is an exploration of __dreams__ as a hermeneutic problem - what they are, what things cause them, and the __many words__ used to define them. [_polysemy, crisis of language; are dreams always the same? what should we do about this signified with many signifiers?_] it is unclear whether ch. is referring to a real or to a literary problem. is he talking about a __genre__ (as the discussion of vocabulary might suggest), or about an experience? perhaps his attempt is to open the experience of dreams to other matters.


110. the invocation seems a __mixture of pagan and christian__ religious beliefs. __past and present__.

218. the temple of __venus__ - a combination of __written and visual__ experience, beginning with the first few lines of the aeneid, and shifting to a depiction of the trojan war and its aftermath from the standpoint of the __pagan deities involved__, venus especially. is this a meditation on the role of love in history? or the __persistence__ of these religious figures, or this specific poem, __in our present__?

	- love is, proverbially, the __unspeakable thing__ in chaucer - the thing that can never be retold or paraphrased. as dido is introduced, the speech moves from __summary to paraphrasis__, to __retelling__, up to dido's direct speech.

350. dido laments the loss of her __fame__ - doxa - in terms that could be reminiscent of boethius' meditations [_on fame and fortune as ephemeral, unstable, casual._]. fame is here her good __name__ (a woman's name), stolen by e.

426. dido seems the core of this first book, as if the whole aeneid revolved around her loss and betrayal; after her story we find a series of __exempla__ of women betrayed.

508. we have here the __desert__ outside the __temple__ - whose images were genuinely unbeatable - ant the vision of the golden eagle flying towards the dreamer. still emphasis on __vision__.

##Book 2

510. the prologue is addressed to every man "that englissh understonde kan." __translation__.

710. the eagle explains the purpose and the cause of this physically "noyous" journey through the heavens; he has been sent there by jupiter, as a reward for the poet's faithfulness to the religion of __love__; and it will carry the poet to the _house of fame_, where he will be able to hear __new stories__ to tell. the literal meaning, from now, is that there is something __unwritten__, beyond vergil.

822. the eagle describes the physical (scientific) premises for the unlikely existence of the house. this mixture of __sophisticated scientific and religious__ discourse seems a true parody of dante, effective and possible because it uses the deities of the __past__.

924. but the eagle might also be, more generally, a parody of the __disciple/master__ relationship found in the visionary genre - everything that the master says has to be believed. the poet seems skeptical - he answers positively to everything, but there is an element of doubt. didn't the eagle use, for instance, "figures of poetrie" and "termes of philosophie" in his demonstration? so why would we believe him immediately?

1010. the dialogical exposition continues with the same mixture of __myth__ (hycarus) and __science__ - or __philosophy__ (boethius, recalled by the dreamer), until it reaches a halt - the poet is too old to know about the stars. _is this eagle imaginative?_ is this eagle the __visionary capacity of poetry__, drawing on nature as a way to know more?

1042. to confirm our impression about this section being about imaginative, the sound produced around the __house of fame__ is introduced by two _natural similes_.

1090. one final premise: like ghosts in the afterlife, the species found in the _hof_ have the appearance of their earthly counterparts "red or blak." this is not justified at all.

##Book 3

1109. the final invocation is to apollo, that should grant the poet a finer ability to compose.

1200. the two palaces: one made of __ice__, with preserved and melted names, and one made of "beryle," holding "alle maner of mynstralles" in the same place.

1304. the exterior of the "beryle" palace, splendid, shiny, and again almost transparent, is covered by the many poets of antiquity who played instruments and songs. it is a triumph of __music__, from orpheus to the magicians and witches of myth.

	- these poets seem to be remembered still, but not their texts; they are the __unwritten tradition of musicians__, outside the gates of the palace.

1392. from the wonderfully rich palace, golden all around and guarded by knights from every possible army, we shift to the description of __fame__ - "a femynyne creature" that has __monstruous__ elements: infinite eyes, ears, and tongues, and __changing size__ [_from infinitely small to infinitely large._]

1519. we understand that the poets of antiquity found here are, in fact, __instruments of fame__, not seekers of fame themselves, at least in the fiction. they strive and compete to preserve the fame of the stories which they tell, of the rulers, characters, deities and peoples that they have sung. they bring these tales to the ears of fame.

	- there seems to be a strong __political implication__ here - poets serve power.

1867. the core of this section is the __irrational, unpredictable, unjustified__ behavior of fame, who is as __casual__ as her sister, __fortune__. what is described here is an elaborate system for which people achieve good or bad reputation.

	- the poets stay on the background, but their function is clear - assist the rulers.

1916. here the dreamer encounters an anonymous "friend," who asks him why he is there. the dreamer explains that he seeks no fame - only stories to tell.

	- paradoxically, the dreamer here states that __fame__ is not the story that he wants to tell.

1976. the destination is now a rotating labyrinth made out of twigs, a combination between a suspended nest and a lively metropolis [_london_]. here is every sound, from the squeaking of branches and leaves to the most dramatic human stories, summarized in a long anaphora - "ful of..." [_the stories of historical people; reality breaking through the doors of allegory - from the highest level of abstraction and historical distance - vergil - to the midpoint of imaginative, the poetical intersection between material and transcendental discourses - to the broken speech of reality._]

2042. thanks to the __divine mediation__ of the eagle, an instrument of jupiter, the poet is allowed to enter the enormous nest, which would otherwise resist his physical weight. this is __london__, and this is __time__. the dreamer finds more people within than he believed it possible; it is resistant and yet ephemeral, poor [_not the noble beryle and gold of the previous section; this is our temporality, although historically durable._]

2120. this democratic house precedes the __monarchic__ stage of fame's decision; here the making of a story (of an __aventure__, a term used here) is __horizontal__, from peer to peer, and in time. then the story reaches __fame__, who decides its preservation.

2158. the dreamer is able to learn many stories, several of which are clearly lies, before hearing the __commotion__ caused by the love story surrounding the "man of gret auctorite."
