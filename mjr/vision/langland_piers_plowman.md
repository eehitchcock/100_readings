##Ideas

- The language arts appear, for instance, when Will and Conscinence discuss the difference between direct and indirect relation (it is the reward due to a person, in contrast with _mede_); they frame the conversation around the difference between Latin and vernacular.

- Temporality is highly problematic in the poem; the narrative compresses, dilates, and suspends time. Consider the social critiques of the first section of the poem, the theological digressions of the second section, and the temporal compression for which Will witnesses the entirety of history in the conclusion.

##Commentary

###Prologue

13. the first few lines juxtapose __experience__ and __dream vision__; after having traveled and __seen things__ in the world, the poet falls asleep in the place where he was born. he's able to __see the world__ while his eyes are closed; and to see it more clearly. it is one of the most conscious treatments of the genre we have seen - of what the genre entails. the poet talks as if his audience already knew what to expect from this premise: higher truths. the persistence of the verb to see, awake and asleep, is controversial. [_because seeing is not always the path to truth; because seeing can be deceiving. because the vision that one seeks in contemplation should not be vision as we understand it every day. see cloud of unknowing._]

24. the people in the _fair field_ are organized in a hierarchical society that consciously refers back to that of __winnere and wastoure__. the labor and the ruler.

66. the people roaming around the field seem to be concerned with the problem of salvation and truth. how do we achieve a higher knowledge of god, here on our earthly domain? we have __vita activa__ and __contemplativa__, the pilgrims, the beggars, the theologians. the perspective is: how do we keep living against the presence of __transcendent__ realities? these are __truth__ and __death__.

	- the final problem is __confession__ for __money__: "the moste mischief on molde."

95. two sudden turns: the first is __narrative__ and geographically recognizable, with the clergy wanting to go to __london__ (in time of pestilence, in the __past tense__); the second is the appearance of an __allegorical personification__ - consience.

133. conscience's speech uses exempla from the scriptures (especially one obscure story from the __old testament__, about two false priests) to prompt a sense of contrition in the __corrupt clergy__. the good comparison is peter and his four virtues.

	- the language is clever and cleverly manipulated. the __cardinal virtues__ make us think about the _cardinals_ who elect the pope (_analogy_, __poetry__ as an intepretive tool).

139. enter a new character, a __kyng__ and two advisers, __kynde witt__ and _consience_.

	- has this political shift any affinities with the __meaning-making__ parliament of fowls?

166. the __kyng__ and the two allegorical personifications establish a new political system, possibly virtuous or functional - one where they rule the other classes with sense, authority and mercy (all summarized in __latin verses__). but from the image of the court, with a number of functionaries ready to serve, we switch to the __rats__.

191. the parable of the __mice__ seems to treference both ch.'s "fowls" and a small passage in __boethius__ about the absurdity of human power (like a mouse domineering the rest of the mice). is it an ironical parallel for the organized, virtuous government of the conscious king? who is the __dangerous cat__ that the mice have to avoid, then? the devil? sin? death? are the mice facing an ethical problem - so that they want to know in advance when __death__ is approaching? there is, of course, a political reading too, about the infant richard ii, happening later.

235. reiteration of the premise - in his sleep, the dreamer is able to perceive a __vivid urban setting__, full of colorful characters and fragments of colloquial speech the __london__ of his vision. the focus is on senses: sound, taste, smell too.

###Passus 1

4. the problem of __decyphering__ the setting; the poet suggests this possibility - that a solution, a code, might be foreseeable. [_he explicitly mentions the existence of one interpretation for the tower and the dale._]. here enters __holy church__; she explains how the people in the _mase_ right now ignore what is beyond it - they see no heaven above.

40. the church is already offering solutions to the main problem of the book - or is it? the first question was "what does this mean?" - and the answer here is "this is what you should do." the church identifies evils in excess - lust, gluttony - and remedies in measure; the mode is suddenly __homiletic__ - she quotes from the scriptures, and instructs the dreamer accordingly. a sheep in front of her, to be led anywhere. [_that is, the dreamer has become similar to a sheep - not a disciple to enlighten, but an animal to drag around._]

	- it is a sample of the sort of solutions that the church might give, looking at the scriptures simply to impose - forget the wrecchede world, remember the bible.

67. the opposition between __spaces__ is resolved epistemologically: truth here, and wrong there.

	- implying, therefore, that what the men in the field are doing is __looking for what truth is__.

101. church presents her organization of society: everything, from mornarchy to "knyghthed" (the bellatores), has to serve truth, and that has to be __protected__ at all costs.

136. church moves from the earthly ranks of the preservers of truth to the heavenly soldiers of god - the angels - and the fall of lucifer. that was the origin of evil with the fall of lucifer a distinguishable evil was created, and men can identify it geographically. [_from this very beginning we see the coexistence of a temporal and an atemporal plane; church is comparing what has happened with what should happen - history with what is beyond history._]

167. as will asks about "kynde knowinge," the church answers with __love__, love that is the measure and the instruction for everything; it is _within ourselves_, and it is also __christ__.
	
	- this shifting symbol - referent/signifier (or signified?) should regulate human activity.

204. the conclusion is again homiletic: truth is love, now go and love. scripture and __instruction__, with a loose argumentation. the truth seems to be fairly shallow here.

##Passus 2

6. will's sense of frustration is obvious: i can get some of what you say - but how can i in fact distinguish the true from the false? is this "kynde knowinge" truly sufficient?

19. to teach false and true (__pedagogy of experience__, for the reader as well - not "theory" but "practice" [_not contemplativa but activa_]), church shows the __allegorical personification of mede__ to the dreamer [_and to the reader_]. what do you make of this, now?

	- interpreting __entities__. ethical choices.

70. a feast of __allegorical personifications__, celebrating mede's marriage to falsehood. the mode is not just __spatialization__; it is __narrative__: the abstract entities are __doing__ things that are __meaningful__, and they are interacting among them in a meaningful way [_the narrative mode, in time - differently from the atemporal spaces of guillaume and the early chaucer - is another way to make meaning._]. they occupy __social roles__, act like the characters of a __plot__.

116. the document sealing the marriage is almost satirical in its insistence - and it is only trying to make one point - mede is now united to false. here we have the appearance of another mode typical of the poem: common citizens - __historical people__ - mingle with these entities, are __with__ these entities. here _wronge_ is the first witness of the marriage, and follow "peres the pardoner," "butte the bedel" [_that is, wronge and two historical guys play an equivalent role in the plot._]

196. the narrative aspect of this allegory includes a familiar geography - here we find __london__ and westminster. to get there the allegories ride the __latin names__ of the functionaries that they have managed to corrupt. __satirical romance__.

255. the context is still that of the king's good rule; he tries to prevent the marriage from happening. "drede" runs back to the "false" personae, and they scatter away.

##Passus 3

67. continues here the __combination__ between _satirical_ and _narrative mode_; mede interacts with historical people, representatives of each social class, to woo them into her devotion and acceptance. [_satirical is political, narrative is argumentative._]

	- she has specific gestures and style. [_that is, her way of speaking and her recurrent gestures - not actions specifically - as a character contribute to her definition as an allegorical entity, to our understanding of her meaning._]

76. __homiletic__ digression: at times we hear the voice of the __poet__ himself, instructing the audience. [_that voice is often homiletic. but who is truly speaking here?_]

107. the narrative section becomes a meditation on theological mede - on what would be __fortune__ for boethius. it is the __problem of evil__, here expressed trhough the fire that burns both the virtuous men's and the wicked's houses. [_that is, bad things happen to good people, and earthly rewards do not match our virtuous behavior._]

341. a debate between _conscience_ and _mede_, in front of the kyng - who has to decide on her stay in the city. conscience reiterates old arguments; and mede surprises the reader. she is clever and rational and lucid, and she makes a good case for why society requires her presence. her speech contains references to the scriptures, latin quotations, and elaborate ideas.

425. the conclusion of conscience's speech insists on the contrast between __direct__ and __indirect__ relation, a problem that is only possible in __latin__. only _mercede_ can be proper for the purpose.

	- __language__ itself works through a system of _rewards_, apparently; so that _mercede_ is the basis of scripture as well. latin is harmony and a model for a good society. [_is this always true? it could be here - latin is that fixed model of perfect reciprocity, disrupted by the temporal inevitability of the vernacular._]

463. as her speech ends, conscience foresees what the reign of kind love might be like - a realm where everybody is laboring in the countryside - no weapons but plows, a collective __agrarian salvation__. peace is a society of _laboratores_.

500. the conclusion is a dispute over a passage in __latin__, found in the "sapiense"; conscience is a __conscious reader__, and teaches mede how to read the recto and the verso of each page. [_reading latin properly - again, the scripture and its language as the model of social and personal virtue._]

##Passus 4

23. reason prepares his horses to ride towards the king's court; the horses are basic pieces of advice, imperatives of common sense turned into proper names (cliches?). [_this is a frequent mode in langland, and one that we have not completely considered yet; pieces of language, fixed expressions and phrases, become objects in the real world, creatures, people and spaces. it is the case of dowel too. in the end, the world of langland is linguistic._]

89. this small trial is the triumph of the __narrative__ take on allegory - the poet uses it to solve disputes, to formulate problems and to seek solutions for them. he is clearly asking - "what would conscience do? what would wit reply?" [_notice the hypothetical mode of imagination._] and there is no evident __hierarchy__ for their influence on the king.

	- the crimes committed by wrong against pees are a combination between __allegory and synecdoche__ - they stand for all. [_the interaction between the two figures probably deserves more attention._]

147. resoun gives her final word of advice in latin, asking the clerkes to "construe" its meaning. [_again, this is something that happens in later moments of the poem too._]

	- translation of norm; the norm is the very process of __translation__, in its essential __grammar__.

196. the conclusion is ambiguous towards meed, but clearer towards the __method__: conscience and reason can lead the king (and the poet/reader) to good decisions that have __social__ outcomes. [_much of the focus of the poem is methodological; how we discover truth, not what truth is._]

##Passus 5

21. the poet is interrogated by reason (and conscience) as he wakes up in his london house, and he is living lazily though his body is apt for labor. why doesn't he live by his words?

70. the poet defends his own _vita contemplativa_; he has the means to afford it, and he's useful.

104. the apologia is insufficient, and the poet needs to pray for god's grace. he has lied - and he has led a sinful life of __indolence__. as he goes to church, the poet falls asleep again.

113. the landscape of the dream, again; the king and his men. i truly think that the king is will. [_as in parliament, the king would stand for the self's ability to make decsions about meaning, and about the reality surrounding him._]

167. reasoun's sermon to the folk on the field first identifies in _pride_ the cause of the pestilence; then instructs every person on how to live ethically, and finally devotes a long section of her speech to the various religious orders, which should not be _greedy_.

	- the language of __sins__ is already part of the speech and the narrative; so is __contrition__.

##Passus 6

2. this is probably the first time we hear "will," the name of the dreamer. he cries. [_the cry is a reaction to contrition, an attempt to repent his own ways; his apologia is a social apologia, a collective apologia; the poem is constantly meditating on the interactions between the self and society; in a way, the king is both will and the king - both the decisive capacity of the self, and the decisive capacity of society._]

103. the seven sins __awake__ - they are __types__; they are the _synecdoche_ of the vices that we find on earth - the collection of those features that characterize men corrupt by these vices. they are an expression, a gesture, and a style. the mode is a __procession__. somehow, langland is only rewriting a preexisting tradition here, not changing it deeply.

	- the striking feature is that those sins are always __with__, not __within__ historical people. they live among ordinary people, they do not rule them as gods nor posess them like demons. [_the being "with" is a central idea in the poem; you are "with" something until you have become that something._]

	- perhaps there is a social implication beyond this - or even an economic one. these goods. [_that is, vices are like items, like commodities or like economical forces, circulating between us, making transactions possible, regulating our desires - think about the conclusion of winnere and wastoure, with wastoure moving to london to make economy thrive._]

	- the example of "wrathe" in the convent is great; she just waits until it's her moment to "__awake__." [_a silent presence "with" the other figures, until her moment to act begins._]

	- one implication is that these elements are an integral part of our society and economy, the other is that by __sinning__ we __become sins__ - that _couetyse_ was just a _covetous man_.

234. and maybe there is a plot here - a narrative structure - about the fact that, in the end, sins become a part of an individual - so deeply rooted in one's identity that true __repentance__ becomes impossible. perhaps there is an argument in this __narrative climax__.

	- covetise seems to be at the center of this procession - his section is the longest, his repentance is the hardest. this is definitely a poem about the __individual__ and __society__. categories like the sins - or other __allegorical personifications__ - mediate between them.

375. the conclusion, on the other hand, is in the tavern, with __glutoun__ and his mates, who eat and drink instead of repenting their ways, thus persisting in sin.

	- we get a glimpse of the corrupt economy from the standpoint of the __lower corrupt classes__.
	
	- this is also a small narrative digression by itself, an __ordinary story__ of sin and failed repentance.

	- it is a story of __addiction__ that we are all familiar with; the exemplum of unredeemable.

##Passus 7

54. the last line of sleuth's is the latin line used for will - that is, the "heu michi quod sterilem duxi vita iuvenilem" with which church reprimanded him. we get the impression, therefore, that this is his sin - and that the __personification__ is close to him.

69. again, the __narrative__ mode of the poem switches to the __homiletic__ mode of will's voice.

	- the problem is that of the flattering minstrels, the songs that delude their audience, and that prevent __change__ from happening - prompting the persistence of __sleuthe__. here will is asserting the importance of his new role - that of a __minstrel of disruption, discomfort__. in a way, he is anti-ideological - he wakes conscience up.

150. repentance praises the possibility of forgiveness and __redemption__ - the fact that __history__ is the sequence leading from the original sin (necessary) to the sacrifice of the cross- that still allows every man to be saved. summary of this. [_an individual's temporal trajectory from innocence to sin, and from sin to redemption, is mirrored in the history of the universe, from the tree of knowledge to christ on the cross._]

158. and here is the problem - the thousands of men gathered there do not know the way to reach __truth__. they do not know how to _behave_ properly for redemption.

182. here we have the appearance of piers; he knows truth and the way to get there. his speech follows the failed attempt to obtain the same information from a __pilgrim__.

282. piers' instructions are a combination of formulas and virtues drawn from the __scriptures__ and the conventions of __homiletic__ speeches. the first part is the denial of sin; what follows is a fortress of faith, inhabited by allegorical personifications. __spatialization__, once again; the future tense and the imperative mode make it hypothetical. [_pieces of instructions contribute to the establishment of an allegorical space, of a metaphysical space._]

308. in the conclusion, the crowd is not ready to follow the hard path of redemption, yet.

##Passus 8

79. here we have piers' conversion to the ways of a __pilgrim__, as a guide for those virtuous christians who will choose to follow him. he turns the symbols of his labor into those of a spiritual traveler. this is a passus about the establishment of a new __virtuous society__, where classes collaborate for a higher sort of good.

111. piers has a will prepared for himself; it's a way to have him describe his __property__.

	- what does he materially own, and what is he investing? important questions for the poet.

196. allegory becomes __history__ - an agent of history. the wastor stops working for piers, and the society cannot function as expected any more. a number of __historical people__ protest. eventually piers invokes hunger to provide a stronger impulse to work. and the remedy is effective - the wasters are forced to produce food.

	- types and entities - they all interact as the characters of social history here.

314. at the end of a long dialogue with hunger, piers seems completely identifiable with the poor farmers that he is instructing. he is hungry as well, and powerless against hunger. [_this too seems an instance of "being with."_]

	- the conclusion of the passus leaves hunger as a __necessity__ that has vicious consequences.

##Passus 9

36. treuthe participates in the collective project of earthly salvation initiated by piers; she prepares a pardon that will redeem every worker in his field, and every worker for his field (bellatores too), and she organizes the redistribution of the wealth gathered by the merchants, so that it could be used for school and institutions.

280. the body of the passus is a long digression about beggars and social parasites, and about the negligence of the church in keeping the categories under their rule. we get the impression that this pardon, by excluding parasites, is excluding many __oratores__.

	- the book is, for now, clearly against the existence of an unstustainable contemplative class.

292. the pardon only says "dowel" - and there is no pardon there, therefore. it is not enough, we might assume. the poet wakes up, again, in the "maluerne hulles," and remembers his dream.

352. the quest for "dowel" might begin. this is perhaps the most problematic allegorical personification - an __imperative__. what does an imperative precisely stand for? and how does it behave, and where can it be found in society? how does it affect our world?

##Passus 10

67. the opening is one of the few passages where will is awake - dressed as a pilgrim on a quest for dowel, he runs into two friars, whom he questions about his objective.

	- one of them uses an elaborate allegory whose meaning remains unclear; perhaps we should learn that will isn't ready for this knowledge, yet; or that the __allegorical method__ is inefficient.

74. the first personification found by will is his own "thouhte." an inner force, turned into an external agent, assisting will in his physical quest, leading his thoughts.

	- still, the question remains - is it thought in general, or is it will's thinking ability? and how common was the latter in the conventions of the genre - someone's personification. [_that is, the personification of an individual's intellectual or affective faculty, and not that faculty in general, as it exists outside ourselves, as its own independent entity?_]

113. the way in which thought is here signified is through walking - advancing through physical space while keeping one's destination at hand. thought cannot guide will to dowel's place, but only to wit - he will know. thought seems to distinguish between social functions in his taxonomy of dowel, dobet and dobest, with laboratores as the lowest and bellatores as the highest rank. [_the first approach to this ethical problem - how do i behave well - is to look for the answer outside of the self, look at the ways in which this is mirrored in society; objective representations of social ranks._]

307. wit's speech identifies the triad of do's with the human self, from the body to the soul; consistently with the introduction (where the friar's allegory was a comparison between the __boat__ and the __carnal body__), he condemns lechery and wedding as ways of alienating dowel. [_more should be done about the passus as independent units, like dante's cantos, where apparently unrelated discussions or images actually form a consistent whole._]

##Passus 11

90. through the intervention of __studie__ we now include learning in our exploration. wit cannot operate by itself, but it needs its wife to properly look for truth.

	- so langland has turned an __argument__ - a thought process, a hermeneutic circle - into a __narrative__.

164. scripture and clergy lead the dreamer to a site of unknowing - so that he has to fall asleep again, to travel to a deeper understanding - the "lond of longyng and love."

	- this is the section of the "dream-within-a-dream", led by __fortune__. we find here the "myrrour that hihte myddelond." it is an autobiographical passage, where the ethical forces governing the self are __personified__ - "elde" and "rechelessenesse."

	- the point being that "rechelessenesse" is incredibly persuasive; she uses the weapons of _scripture_ and _clergy_ against them, and eventually manages to lead will astray.

##Passus 12

4. notoriously, this is the moment when the dreamer and rechelessenesse have become one.

22. temporal synecdoche - the entirety of the dreamer's life is two lines, from youth to poverty and old age. the religious and the social mix; redemption (absolution) costs money. what follows is a debate about __universal salvation__; rechelessenesse has the last word - she argues that, since salvation is universal, learning and richness (wordly | earthly | material pursuits) are worth very little; she praises "pacient poverte."

##Passus 13

128. the conclusion of rechelessenesse's speech employs an elaborate allegory - that of the christian as a messenger reaching his destination - to argue for universal salvation and against the importance of clergy. it is useful to consider the __argumentative importance__ of this digression here - the poet literally __fetched__ rechelessenesse - which is now used as an intellectual, even epistemological method - from the story of his own psychological life - drawn from the __narrative of life__ into the __narrative of understanding__.

	- the "y" that looks in the mirror used as a reply to this position, however, seems again the intellectual pilgrim of the previous section. the __mirrori__ is the same natural world described by __alain__, only with "rasoun" governing nonhuman life, rather than nature.

204. a line in __french__ is used by resoun to reply to the dreamer's question about why we err - why we lack her direction. __free will__ is something that man shouldn't be concerned about, because it is one of god's inscrutable decisions. inevitable.

245. the dreamer has reached a point of halt, and he wakes up - his exploration of this new theological problem has to be __patient__, and reason is therefore insufficient.

##Passus 14

10. the new faculty used to pursue the quest for dowel is __ymagenatyf__; this is apparently connected to will's poetic ability, and to the contemplation of __nature__; it is, possibly, the ability to connect elements of the material plane to construct meanings that are not immediaely __rational__ - thus a means associated with __theology__.

217. the passus seems a __turning point__ - it is formally different in that it is a long __monologue__ by this character, imaginative, interrupted only by a couple of submissive answers by the poet, now turned a disciple. it seems a __defense of poetry__ as a means to achieve an intellectual knowledge that is crucial to obtain salvation. the figure also identifies herself with the observation of __nature__ - thus giving sense to the role of this function in other texts (boethius, de lorris); it is also a defense of __vision__ in __dreams__.

##Passus 15

24. a new awakening and a new sleep. after the introduction of imaginative, the method seems different. we find here a summary of the previous section, focused on the __autobiography__.

67. the idea of a __banquet of knowledge__ is, by itself, imaginative. this could be the triumph of this pedagogical method - what the __dreamer__ can now do by applying the __intellectual__ faculties that he has met and invited during his intellectual journey. and will is now sitting next to patience, having learnt that his knowledge has to advance slowly and humbly. the meal is cooked by _contricioun_. notice how these personifications behave: they operate __with__ or __around__ the character, not __within__, not __against__ - but by his side.

149. piers disappears from the banquet after having praised patience. what is his role in an intellectual conversation about the role of patience in pedagogy and salvation? [_that is, are these concerns that we might refer to piers in any case? or are they very distant from his domain - the active effort to found a virtuous society?_]

195. a new journey begins - patience and conscience, followed by will, now meet _activa vita_. has the topic shifted from intellectual meditation to ethical behavior? or have they combined?

	- so that now __activa__ and __contemplativa__ must work __side by side__ - knowledge and good deeds.

	- from __knowing__ what dowel is to __doing__ what do well is - a new kind of endeavor.

306. after an initial contrast, based on patience's focus on __immaterial__, rather than __material__ goods, patience and vita activa conclude this passus as __complementary forces__.

##Passus 16

113. the opening is a long monologue by patience, where we find a refusal of richness - and sin - and a praise of a society where goods are shared among humble christians.

182. after a praise of poverty we have the introduction of __liberum arbitrum__, and his many names.

370. the ethical (practical?) quest of will now focuses on finding __charite__, which seems _imitatio christi_.

##Passus 17

390. the passus explores the notion of charite as imitatio christi, and its relationship to the church. it eventually becomes a __history of christianity__ and the other monotheistic confessions from the standpoint of true charity. in/tolerance. [_the passus remains very distant from the contemporary reader, one of the hardest to decypher as a whole without an accurate historical background; langland's history oscillates between orthodoxy and heterodoxy, between acceptance and refusal of the other._]

	- liberum arbitrum has become will's only interlocutor right now. he has __all the thought__. [_that is, probably, the persona has become a free faculty with a deternination of its own, and it could either pursue truth or get farther from it._]

##Passus 18

104. the dreamer is now exploring a metaphysical (or allegorical) space, where he finds the __tree of ymago-dei__, the shifting mirror of trinity that is embodied in the human being. this is shaken by "elde" - in __time__ and __history__.

	- the tree becomes the tree of knowledge; allegory and (in) time is the book [_that is, allegory within and outside time forms the essence of the book as a narrative and argumentative text._]


290. the narrative - history - becomes the gospel, up to the harrowing of hell. there we meet a new character - the personification of __faith__, and abraham at the same time. he explains a metaphor for the __trinity__, and tells his story.

##Passus 19

95. after spes we find the good samaritan and his story, retold and embedded here. the __road__ is a way to incorporate history and stories in the main narrative.

278. the good samaritan uses two effective __similes__ to explain the trinity; and he insists, again, on the value of __charity__ in the path to salvation. this is dowel.

	- __dowel is a simile__ - a synthesis of material and immaterial, activa and contemplativa. [_not entirely clear; are we talking about the word? no, we are talking about the two similes adopted by the samaritan, that should be associated with dowel as the final goal established by the book - a synthesis of activa and contemplativa in ethos and in everyday behavior, the practical path to salvation; the mixture between activa and contemplativa is mirrored in the quality of the similes, objects drawn from the material plane that are used to explain something transcendent. again, this is a method._]

##Passus 20

29. a new awakening, and a new vision - jesus is wearing the __armor of a knight__, and he is competing in a tournament. we find the imagery of __romance__ here.

268. this is the suspension of history that leads to the entrance of __boek__ as a judge for what should happen - scripture solves the conflict between truth and mercy.

475. after a legal dispute between jesus and satan, the conclusion is the consolation of __salvation__. 

##Passus 21

481. again in the narrative mode of romance, the dreamer witnesses the foundation and the fall of __unite__.

##Passus 22

198. after the presentation of __nede__, we have a __vision of the apocalypse__. accelerated time and history.
