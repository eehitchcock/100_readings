#General Prologue /1

##Introduction

- Chaucer has been interested in the project of writing a collection of short narratives for some time before devising the idea of a __pilgrimage__ - around 1387.

	- The book says "the late 1380s." We know that some tales existed in some form before the moment when Ch. actually decided to write them down as a whole.

- Many precedents - from _The Confessio Amantis_, by Ch.'s friend Gower, to the old _Seven Sages of Rome_, to the cardinal insipration of _Decameron_.

##Commentary

18. The setting and the premise are indeed those of a __visionary text__; we have the soothing though reinvigorating presence of __nature__ - a locus amoenus with water and birds that would, in other circumstances, prompt sleep - and the very idea of a pilgrimage, the __road__ that was a device in __langland__, previously used as a metaphorical space to represent an __argument__ and more stories.

42. the __narrator__ has a role in the text - he is a __witness__ and a character; the opening could again resemble similar texts, but we soon move to the __group__. [_by similar texts we mean visions, where the narrator is usually telling his own experience to the reader, and interpreting it for him._]

207. these descriptions are certainly more detailed than any other character encountered so far; but some of these details - some clothing accessories, some gestures, or sayings, might have a traditional association with the __allegorical personae__ that we encountered elsewhere. [_that is, these types are also allegories; some of their traits are definitely already present in the depictions of sins or social categories of previous texts._] __synecdoche__ could be the common ground between __personae__ and __types__ such as these. there is also a sense of continuity with political meditations such as __winnere and wastoure__, where social classes form a __complementary whole__; the problem of __vita activa__ and __contemplativa__ is here too.
