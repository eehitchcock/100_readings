#Fragment 9

##The manciple in the general prologue

586. the portrait seems __short and elusive__. the man is described as "gentle" and cunning in his trade; he buys provisions for his court slyly, and always getting the best deal. he outsmarted every clever lawyer that worked in the house/court for which he worked. the passage could suggest that __money__ (trade) matters more than the law.

	- the lawyers need food, and food is beyond their jurisdiction; the market is all.

##The manciple's prologue

104. a delightful small scene, to show the way in which the manciple's control over supplies and commodities corresponds to his control over people. he insults the cook's drunkenness, and then, having angered him, confronts him and gains his friendship and trust by giving him some wine. the host mediates between the two characters. on the road scene.

##the manciple's tale

154. __theoxeny__. the story is about phoebus during his days on our earth, as a common man. he is an excellent archer, bachelor (lover), and singer. he has a white crow that sings more beautifully than any bird (and man? and god?) and a wife whom he pleases diligently every night, despite his jealousy.

	- here the pagan deity has become a random person, driven by common desires and flaws (jealousy).

195. the __boethian simile__ of the soul tending towards god, when left free, in the some way as a bird tends towards wilderness when freed from any beautiful cage, becomes here an image of lust - we tend towards our desires, when we are free to pursue them. the simile is degraded - a bird seeking the woods, a cat seeking a mouse, and eventually a she-wolf seeking a wolf to copulate. instinct for sinfulness.

	- the perversion of the simile already describes well the character of the manciple. for him humans are simply coterminous with their basic __material means [needs]__. not divine.

222. a remarkable linguistic digression - the manciple uses the word "lemman," and he expresses that the thing remains the same, regardless of __vocabulary and social status__. we use better words to designate the sin of the powerful and the rich, but they're just the same.

291. after having heard the testimony of the crow - who starts by crying "cokkow! cokkow!," and then shifts to an explicit __human speech__, like in parliament - phoebus kills the wife and destroy both his musical instruments and his war gear. then, in a __monologue__, he repents and blames the bird for having been a false witness.

	- words seem to be a focal interest for this tale - verbal and nonverbal elements, creatures, signs. apollo destroys the symbols of his human existence, because of an animal that triggered his wrath. he decides to kill himself.

362. the tale ends with a __praise of silence__, which avoids tragedy - here, besides death and destruction, the etiological description of the crow's punishment, turned black and speechless [_this is a moment that prof. johnson defined ovidian, and proper of a beast fable_]. the moral is spoken by a __motherly voice__; the manciple might be reporting his mother's speech. it is better to be silent, like a beast [_is this a definitive critique of the genre of dream vision and its pedagogical potential, now in crisis? we have here a tale whose contents and message are absolutely questionable; should we trust it?_].
