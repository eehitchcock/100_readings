##Ideas

- The character of _Genius_, who tells the stories that constitute the book, can be compared to _Imaginative_ in Langland; he teaches by appealing to the literary senses. 

- The turning point in the prologue is the dream of Nabuchodonosor, interpreted by Daniel; here the poet moves from _historical issues_ to their interpretation; imagination is the instrument that allows the writer to learn from fiction.

##Introduction

- the confessio amantis is a __bilingual poem__ (latin and middle english) in eight books, plus a prologue. "the confessio, like many other late fourteenth century poems, creates a fiction of __soul-searching__" (through __tales in a frame__).

- the editor of this edition - russel peck - keeps comparing gower to chaucer's pardoner.

- the other work by gower that is mentioned here is _vox clamantis_, from 1378-82.

- the confession was written between 1386 and 1390; it is a development of similar ideas.

- the frame of the stories told is a debate between __allegorical personifications of the soul__ [_these are the three levels of this pedagogical treatise, corresponding to the three genres; the level of a confession of the self, corresponding to the penitential manual; the level of an interpersonal love relationship, corresponding to the boethian dialogue about love, and the level of the social meditation on government and history, corresponding to the mirror of princes genre; three levels of analysis, from the individual to the community, and three corresponding genres._]

	- the story of the book stands for the experience of the book - the act of reading its tales.

- this useful introduction contains a brief history of _ymaginatyf_ as one of the brain's faculties. it was - apparently - introduced to the english letters in the later fourteenth century, and it was very influential on gower (and langland!) [_here it corresponds to the character of genius, the confessor and teller of tales_].

- among the personifications, genius has a paramount role. he is drawn from the __visionary tradition__, and he has as direct antecedents _roman de la rose_ and _de planctu naturae_. he might be connected to the very idea of imaginative.

- the editor creates a special genre for gower's tradition, from boethius, to langland, to usk, to this: that of __consolation__. it is a __pedagogy__ - a __pilgrimage__.

- we have about fifty manuscripts of confessio amantis.

##Prologue

92. the concern is immediately that of __writing__ and the ways in which this activity can affect society and history. an english project worth of its latin predecessors. the author insists on "this bok" and its regal readers [_it is a book for the prince; this is the political anxiety that i should be focusing on anyway, the true latent project of the confessio_].

192. the prologue describes the decadence of the __present times__, when society is in constant conflict and peace cannot be successfully preserved. it is a social world which does not mirror its higher models adequately - divinity and love. love is now lost, and the preponderance of __individual interests__ creates poverty and conflict.

	- the idea is that of a __transcendent model__ that should shape the material world.

	- the form alternates latin verses with english _octosyllabic lines_ (short lines, in couplets). the juxtaposition is systematic, like the prosimetrum of __b__.

297. here the contrast between __antiquity__ and the __present__ is based on the contrast between old and new christianity. in recent times the church has become covetous - simony is its greatest sin. christ has been forgotten.

	- the central idea is that of __memory__ - __history is a model__ in the same way as divinity.

437. the poem incorporates many images to discuss or to describe the same idea - here the corruption of the clergy and the decadence of christianity. gower uses, for instance, a parable about sheep and their shepherd. __social poetry__, political concerns.

	- the tone is that of an explicit __indictment__ - homiletic even, form is __expository__.

584. there seems to be a sense of __urgency__ in this book, as if it had been written as a __sudden__ reaction to some __grave contemporary issues__. the poet uses the __commons__ [_please notice well, the commons_] and their dangers as a way to understand __fortune__.

624. the __dream__ of "nabugodonosor." a crucial moment; the premise is that the reality that we perceive with our senses is __deceiving__, and that only the __transcendent__ world that we occasionally experience in dreams truly matters. [_this notion could be relevant to many dream visions that we have read so far; and to the contrast between the two tales contained in the eighth fragment of CT._]

	- the dream is the shattering of a man made of metal; a __stone__ (representing god's power, but also - we guess - fortune) crushes him.

726. from __interpretation__ to __history__; from daniel's explanation of the __dream__ to the __context__ in which it happened. there is a choerent and developed idea of literary theory here. __dreams__ are interpreted in the same ways as tales are interpreted - they contain __transcendent truths__ that should be applied to our own world - __secular society__.

	- here the dream and its meaning are explained to cover the entirety of __history__ from the jewish king to julius caesar.

	- the connection is __imaginative__ - gower uses the bras, silver, gold of the metal man for the different ages of humanity. the connection overcomes the __divide of christianity__.

880. nabucodonosor's dream is therefore a dream about the __entirety of history__ - catastrophic. [_apocalypse, like in the york cycle and in pearl._]

	- the dream is a __vision of time__ and of the __end of time__ - all at once. __instant eternity__. [_this is a dream and a tale; at a certain point in time someone could see the entirety of time; at a certain point in an arcane past someone could see me writing about him; he knew about this instant and all the instants to follow in the history of humanity; the text is a consolation, because every time we know that someone knew we have a sense of providence enacted._]

966. the dream, having a __human form__ at its center, is also an occasion to discuss the __centrality of the human in the universe__. the universe is modeled after the human form; this is the measure of everything we see and sense. (again, the idea of a single model for multiplicity - __boethius' one__.) __interpretation as expansion__.

1052. at the core of gower's cosmology is the contrast between __mortal, human division__ (of time, language, armies), and __divine eternal unity__. this tension has persisted throughout the entire prologue. history is division, temporality, things decaying. interpretation is the quest for __unity__ [_interpretation is the action through which we find the one; interpretation is also alchemy and transformation; isn't the tale of the canon's yeoman, then, another tale about interpretation, about turning the many stones of lapidaries and the broken reality that surrounds us into the single element that is within them all - single gold?_]. (unity beyond __languages__; hence the linguistic fragments making a coherent whole [_we assume english and latin?_].)

1088. the conclusion is in fact a praise of __song__ as an instrument of __unity__ and peace, through the example of __arion__. the __making of synthesis__.

##Book one

1. the first section in __latin__ contains the conventional description of __love__ as a sequence of __oxymorons__. but here it has a new value: love is __unity in contrast__; love is __synthesis__ and peace. the ability to overcome contradiction. [_oxymoron is unity beyond difference; consider this next time you look at this trope, found - for instance - in the whole first section of parliament of fowls._]

60. the beginning of the book contains the same notion - love is hard to understand for mortals, because mortals live __in time__; love is the __resolution of time's conflicts__.

152. the opening is the __conventional__ walk in the woods that we have seen in __visionary texts__; [_locus amoenus,_] spring time, birds chirping, nature awakening, and a sad narrator. he confesses his suffering to the absent gods, when suddenly he is rewarded by a __vision of love__ as venus. two personifications.

	- the models are boethius and the roman de la rose for sure. __visit in vision.__

288. since the poet is a __captive of love__ - he was once a servant - venus asks him to confess his grievances. but she will not receive the confession directly - she has an intermediary and a priest, genius, who will receive the poet's words. genius has learnt what he knows from other books.

	- as the editor explains, the confessor might be a personification of the poet's __imaginative__ [_and we could connect this faculty to the ways in which it is used and discussed in langland and chaucer, or rejected in 'cloud of unknowing'; the intellectual capacity to make images, to see images, and to discover new meaning through them_].

332. an example of the __methodology__ employed here - genius introduces a topic, such as the deceiving quality of the five senses, through which we experience the material forms of love; then he explains the issue through a tale that can be "kepe and warde." it is a __mnemonic__ and __pedagogical__ device - an exemplum.

556. the pedagogical method of this confession multiplies exempla and sources - two stories from ovid (actaeon and medusa), a piece from a bestiary [_or a similar source, perhaps a beast fable_; aspidis the serpent], one episode from "the tale of troie" (the sirens). many fragments to convey one meaning - __interpretation is unity__ [_and unity is what we need to make better rulers, societies, and governments; unity is the model after which we should structure our secular world_]. at the end of this speech, the confessor asks __amans__ if he has, like some of these characters, misused his sight (vision): from pedagogy to __confession__. [_remember that this could be a penitential manual, in a narrative form like the one in langland._]

	- and what about the genre of __vision as a manual for confession__? we see contrition, understanding, and redemption [_different order?_; maybe] in usk, langland, boethius.

707. a different method: the homiletic exposition now contains __types__ - kinds of sinners that are recognizable for their common behavior, repeated in time and space (here it is hypocrites); __unity in diversity__, again. [_the type as a principle of synthesis; in book seven we will find the planets corresponding to the elements affecting people, and determining the identity of social, national and cultural groups; same could be said for chaucer; the type is the beginning of an order._]

964. the tales are used to __illuminate__ facets of sins and behaviors that might be misunderstood otherwise. here genius uses a __romance__ (similar to troilus) to explain the dangers of "hypocrisie" and "dissimilacion": within the tale one of the characters complains, in a direct speech - monologue - about the __same sort of sin__ [_mise en abyme, as if the character was aware of the context in which her story is told; there are some analogies with nabucodonosor's dream as well, history predicted from one point in history, history contained in one point in history_]. always the same - unity in the fragmentation of time.

1076. the cautionary tale works through compassion for the beguiled woman and through an __exemplary punishment__ that becomes a wider historical change (the temple of isis is destroyed). the consequences (social) of sin.

	- unity and fragmentation are perceivable here too - __history absorbs the individual__.

1234. the second exemplum is the trojan horse. the individual (his soul, his personal confession) is juxtaposed with the grand events of __history__ - the quintessential episodes of history. vice (and sin) is the connection between the __single man and its context__ [_also think about dante_].

1342. obedience and disobedience to the beloved woman. perhaps there is a political side to this discussion as well. __love is a political agent of history__.

1861. the tale used to exemplify male obedience to love is a version of the wife of bath's tale; it is more descriptive and less suggestive - a plain __illustration__ of the moral value of submission to a worthy ruler, granting rewards [_strong political valence here too_].

1976. the structure of the book, so far, follows an expanded version of the __procession of sins__; we are now looking at the third kind of pride, presumption ("surquiderie"). none of these sins is actually personified; it is a __controlled exposition__ [_unlike langland_].

2983. examples of "surquiderie" include the theban capaneus (pure ubris), an old anonymous tale of kings (set in hungary), narcissus (distant from the ovidian model). __diversity__.

	- the idea is also that of an __english anthology__, a sample of the language (with latin notes).

2645. it is possible to imagine that each one of these tales might have been read and enjoyed as ain individual piece, with its own development and themes [_and this, again, contributes to the project of developing unity through fragmentation_]. here the story of albinus, which contains reeferences to the wheel of venus (or fortune) that are independent from its immediate context ("boasting"). the marginal notes in latin and the structure of the book would probably allow for this reading mode [_a sort of indexical insistence_].

2771. the __role of poetry__ is constantly present. here we have a contrast between the __making of songs__ and the __vice__ of _veine gloire_. they're in opposition. [_the implication is that there is an ethical way of singing and making poetry and literature; that literature can have a strong social function in the shaping of moral identities and the ehtical stance of the ruling class_.]

2939. the story of nabuchodonosor is repeated here, as an admonition against "veine glory." there is a circular quality granted to this structure. the poet now allows daniel to speak in a direct speech, which contains the teaching [_another mise en abyme_].

	- needless to say, the interpreter of the dream is compared to the reader of the poem.

3042. the connections between the tale and the framing of the collection increase towards the ending, when nabuchodonosor, now turned into a beast, raises a complaint and a confession to god, and is therefore restored to his former state and position (__forgiven__). again the characters interpret themselves, and explicitly __instruct us__.

3446. the final story about pride exemplifies how knowledge and cleverness can lead to salvation; it is told in the form of a __dialogue__ - like the confessio - where a girl answers appropriately to the __riddles__ of her king. modelling reception.

##Book 8

118. the last book begins with a __history of incest__ - from necessity to sin. it incorporates the foul deed within the __cosmic history__ of genesis, with the fall of lucifer leading to the creation of mankind; the original sin and cain and abel. but gower keeps tracing every episode of incest in the old testament.

	- the divide between old and new testament coincides now with the forbiddance of incest [_history is perennially affected by the same sins, by the same agents_].

2008. the core of this final book is the long romance of "appolinus," a transition from the incestuous love of its tragic opening (a king is in love with its daughter) to the virtuous one of the conclusion (the hero is a positive example of marital love, rewarded). this story mirrors the account from genesis to salvation of the earlier section; __history__ is a constant __struggle__ against the __same set of sins__. the __governance__ [_key word_] of eros is its leading pattern [_key concept_]. the tales, always moral in their ending, mirror it.

2148. genius explains (interprets) the tale - history is a balance between the unpredictable circumstances of fortune and the forces of desire - love - which should be regulated to gain salvation. human will moves in this direction.

2215. a __conflict__ between genius and the amans is resolved through a letter. the amans wishes to speak to love, whereas genius teaches him reason. __pedagogical contrast__ [_the teaching is about the regulation of eros, and the seventh book was all about lechery; but the amans insists to have love, like every human being_].

	- the letter written by amans is in the __ryme royale__ used by chaucer. higher style? [_definitely; there is a whole argument about it being chaucer's choice for religious writing._]

2321. the goddess venus visits the poet, who says his name - "john gower." allegorical personification, in the canonical rural setting; the dreamer is under a tree. a visitation.

2485. the setting becomes completely __visionary__. venus reminds the poet that he is old and mortal, and he suddenly feels weak and cold. cupid leads him to a __parlement__ full of soldiers of love, who seem involved in some sort of celebration [_metaphysical setting; affinities with jean de meun and guillaume, of course, but also with the earlier chaucer of house of fame_.]

2604. the room hosts representatives from every epoch of classical history and myth (in literature); they are exempla of love and unrestrained passion, mixed with the heroes of arthurian romance. it is the space of the poem [_heterogeneous sources_]; __one force, many histories__.

2725. the list is divided into the followers of "youth" and those of "elde," according to __time__; it includes wise men of the old testament [_patriarchs_] and greek philosophy too (plato [_and aristotle, vergil_]).

2869. the poet is forced to confront the evidence of his old age. he feels some shame.

2970. after having __confessed__ the sinfulness of his persistent desire, the poet has to experience the __resignation of his old age__ [_again, think about langland; a huge inspiration for this book, without a doubt_]; he is no longer ready or suitable for love - "por reposer" [_this is written on the bead that venus gives him_]. venus tells him that he should spend his days in __contemplation__, and she gives him some beads to pray. he obeys.

3053. the conclusion is a __prayer__ which begins with the __constatation of present degradation__. like the opening section, it is a description of social sins, pride and greed [_the entire poem is bracketed by a social meditation and a sense of urgency; the poet has to intervene_].

	- a description of an ideal state, modelled after god's rule, follows here as well [_and isn't it the true purpose of the book?_].

3172. the last few lines are a __defense of the book__ and its project, an english poem that could __teach and entertain__; a guide to good government, and love.

##Book 5

116. avarice; the sin is first considered in its __social implications__, and in its influence of history (__historical force__), then in its individual and interpersonal connotation. when applied to love, avarice is a form of jealousy and possession. the couple - love - is a __model for the entirety of society__, and for how man affects __history__.

1590. here we find a long digression about the false religions that preceded christianity; after chaldeans and egyptians, genius describes the many false gods of greek religion. they sinned because they __multiplied__ them [_fragmentation_] - against the principle of __unity__. nevertheless, genius teaches amans all that there is to know - they are __useful__ [_like tales, which are fragments of history_] to learn new notions [_intellectual and ethical_]. the passage continues with a __history of religions__ [_including christianity and its historical meaning, the unmaking of the original sin_].

4532. the fundamental equivalence of this section is that between __love__ and __money__; the beloved woman, for instance, behaves like a __usurer__ for amans; she gives away little, and she keeps much for herself. again, love and the self as the __measure for society__.

6058. following this principle, the rape of philomena is used to discuss the vice of ravine.

	- chastity is a __good__ that can be stolen; rape and thievery are equally __immoral__.

7590. the coincidence of __greed and lust__ as the forces that corrupt will create the most tragic events of __history__ [_history is made of this struggle_]; here we find the __destruction of troy__, after paris.

##Book 7

202. the section opens with a reference to aristotle's pedagogical method, the same that instructed alexander. again, gower's project is that of teaching good ways to __govern a country__. the exposition begins by describing the __parts of philosophy__.

520. the two leading ideas in this accurate __description of the universe__ - and mankind's role in it - seem to be __order__ and __unity__; everything begins with god.

	- it is a model of good government; __nature could model human society__ [_idea found in langland, with reason instructing beasts in the mirror of middle earth, and in boethius_].

946. the description includes the correspondences between planets, feelings [_personal inclinations, like melancholy and phlegma_], and peoples [_nations, cultures_]. the idea is that of earth as a reflection of the cosmos (mirror).

	- (gower seems to hate lombardy, to which all sins are imputed.)

1640. gower discusses the importance of the __word__ in defining the human being; the centrality of the word corresponds to the role of __rhetoric__ in pedagogy. [_and remember that this is the pedagogy of the quintessential leader; therefore, words are important to the education of a ruler, and gower's book follows adheres to this project._]

3626. the [_seventh_] book is the first explicitly political one - it follows the points of alexander's education closely, describing __virtues__ as a way to be a good ruler.

5438. the conclusion is a long praise of __chastity in marriage__; from the political sphere we return to the interpersonal one, as a model for each other. [_marriage, however, is also a model and a measure for positive relationship between the members of society, starting with the king and its subjects; therefore, everything that we learn about marriage is something that we might apply to the government of the secular world._]

##The rest

- book 2, 3, and 4 are all devoted to one sin each. they adhere to the __model__ established by the first book, and slowly describe every component of a sin (envy, wrath, sloth) through several related tales. book 6 is about gluttony; consequentely, book 7 should be about lechery. but, since love is discussed in every othe rpart of the poem, we can assume that gower focused on other problems (lechery becomes purely __political__, whereas other sins were sexual - lecherous). [_this structure has been considered problematic and broken by readers through history, especially since the procession of sins duddenly halts around the seventh book, only to be vaguely referred to in the eighth - incest could also be considered as a sort of lechery; the coherence between the seventh book and the rest of the poem is perhaps the biggest critical problem that people have with the confessio._]
