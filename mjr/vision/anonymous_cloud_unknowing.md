##Ideas

- Dense and delicate argument. The book serves as a pilgrimage, that is - it should be read in its entirety, because the solution of the problems it poses arrives at the end, and for those who followed its steps closely; contemplation is the objective of the devotee, as described in the text; temporality is crucial in that man and god are placed on two different planes; remember that the Cloud author has an __atomic__ conception of time - a sequence of atoms. __Imagination__ should be used __not__ to construct images that trap the mind in fantasies, but - on the contrary - to achieve a contemplation of divine secrets.

- The book perhaps addresses one of the critical moments of allegory - or of signification, or of literature as a means to reach the divine; we should not use figures to access the divine - we should just access the divine itself.

##Commentary

- 19. the book becomes an instrument and a token; what allows people to experience the same thoughts and feelings; here the introduction spends ome time on this physical counterpart of __active life__, and, moreover, __contemplative life__. through the physical presence of this book, one becomes a follower of __christ__.

- 41. the introduction, besides, defines its __ideal audience__ and its __ideal mode__ of _experience_. the book should be read from beginning to end, by contemplative men.

- 216. what follows is a __table of contents__ - a short, useful summary of each chapter's content.

- 247. the description of four classes (stages) of humankind, from common to perfect. a pedagogical __progression__, again. the author explains how each stage is the natural, even necessary completion of the previous one. the idea of a __pilgrimage__ is hinted in the last sentence, where the reader "lift up the fote" and "step towardes." reading is __advancing__ - marching forward - and marching is developing - betterment. [_the sense, then, of pedagogical self-improvement as a physical progression through space; its metaphor is the book and each chapter of the same._]

- 272. the theme of the __divine wedding__ of the soul, from the _song of songs_. we are loved by god.

- 289. first mention of the "cloude of unkowing." if you are contemplating god and its universe, you might find - at the beginning, as you start, only "a darknes," confusion, the "cloude." this is where god is found; one reads to be __intellectually__ and __affectively__ ready.

- 315. the book is described as an __atom__. an atom of time. all atoms of human time should be for god.

- 419. two obsessions; the first one is __time__, the unit of human life and its meaning; the second is __positive and negative imagination__. man should use imaginaton for good - to enter the secrets of the cloude - not to picture in his mind what might not be there.

- 448. another premise: the work is not for the contemplation of god's deeds; it's for the __pure contemplation of god himself__. no distractions are truly allowed here.

- 513. the work is contemplation, and contemplation is an attempt to penetrate the __cloud of unknowing__. it works like a manual or a set of instructions, constantly addressing the __reader__ in the __second person singular__. all that is not relevant to the exploration should be buried in the "cloude of forgetting"; most of this first part is a work of __exclusion__ - what is not the bare contemplation of the pure god. to keep the purity of contemplation strong, one can cling onto a __single syllable__ - a word divine - either "__god__" or "__love__."

	- the word is chosen for its simplicity, between language and non-language. does the book itself seek this transparency? the style is certainly easy and concise.

- 630. the only __vision of god__ is the one that is enabled after death, in the hereafter. the work juxtaposes __vita contemplativa__ and __vita activa__ for this reason - in the time of __mortality__ a life spent entirely in contemplation is impossible. But the __attempt__ is. [_how is the dichotomy between contemplativa and activa analogous to that between secondary and primary meaning? how can we have pure contemplation, then, if we keep mixing our meditations with the terrestrial forms that we should be trying to escape? this manual is also a manual about form, about the insufficiency of allegory - allegory is still using those forms that we are trying to reject, to overcome, to transcend._]

- 668. the origin of the __seven deadly sins__ is one - __distraction__. the mind is no longer forgetting people and ideas that live in __time__ - and the memory of pleasure of pain associated to people and things aother than god becomes one of the seven sins. [_how therefore, allegory itself is sinful. how, therefore, we are sinning through tropes and form. this is why, probably, this is a work in prose. far from language - far from the vicious capabilities of language._]

- 680. the __imperative__: "bete evermore on this cloude of unknowing that is betwixt thee and this god with a scharpe dart of longing love." _fix your mind into the unthinkable._

- 797. virtue can be perfect or imperfect, according to its __cause__; if the cause does not depend on the high, metaphysical process of contemplation, then virtue is less commendable. the author keeps introducing dichotomies of this short - man should reach above himself.

- 873. martha and mary - the complementary examples of vita activa and contemplativa.

- 966. this discussion of the gospels is, in fact, allegorical: the author is deciding which is better - contemplativa or activa - on the basis of what jesus historically said to each. martha and marie are turned into __allegroical personae__.

	- notice how the author is distinguishing between __good, better, and best__ - like langland.

- 1114. the similitude of the "holy chirche" as a body, with the limbs being charitable men. the language of the book starts to include exempla, stories from the gospel, allegorical readings and __simile__. are we still in the cloud? the cloud of unknowing is understood by considering the known - the knowable. [_the contradiction is not far from the one perceived in AdL - the problem is the risk of a language becoming too elaborate to remain still virtuous; the problem is that we are condemning tropes while we are forced to use them. the question, then, the radical and the original question is the one that opens boethius - are there two kinds of muses, and how do we differentiate between them?_]

- 1236. after a praise of __vita contemplativa__, the description of the work of contemplation begins by addressing who should approach it, and how.

- 1337. the actual method of the work is impossible to describe - it is a work of approach to the unknown. the author simply tells us about its inseparable parts: "lesson, meditacion, and oryson." these parts are always there - "clerkes redyn on bookes, and lewd men redyn on clerkes." what follows is a praise of the __scripture__ - the _mirror of the soul_ (the author uses a simile here.) [_the method includes language; in fact, it relies and bases itself upon language._]

	- the tone of the book shifts constantly between __abstract__ thought and __concrete__ teaching.

- 1384. the true practictioner of contemplation meditates on a __single word__ - unbroken, thought as an _inseparable_, almost _prelinguistic whole_ - and he prays with a _single word_ - the less, the better. exploring the __threshold of language__.

- 1477. the author is obsessed with __monosyllabic words__ in the english vernacular, chosen for their simplicity and forcefulness. these are the ideal prayers. they work because they are almost meaningless - but also for their __singularity__ - a single utterance that, by itself, in itself, contains the densest possible content. more __signified__, less __signifier__.

	- the objective being a signified that has no linguistic signifier - a cloud.

- 1581. __affective strategy__ - the manual suggests to use love and sorrow as means to forget the self and approach the __god__. man has to transcend his self and become pure __love__.

- 1681. the author recommends to keep the desire for god hidden - unspoken - because there, in the __nonverbal recesses__ of one's intimacy -, is where we are able to achieve a contact with him. similarly, we should attribute to him no shape. [_that is, god has no body; god has no physical - no speakable - presence._]

	- again, this is an explanation of the __ineffable__, of the silent invisible. [_and meditate here on how vision and speech are connected - how ineffable and invisible are the same. are they?_]

- 1824. the author tries to draw a strong distinction between __imagination__ and the _contemplative faculty_; one should not seek god through a sort of _ficition of the senses_ - god should be sought through completely different means.

- 1872. this small section, about the wrong "countenance held by rhetoricians or orators that are too self-absorbed, is a remarkable piece of social description [_but is there more beyond this? isn't this, then the main concern of the manual - the things that orators do that are wrong, that are ethically reproachable? by "countenances" the author actually means gestures and face expressions - the ways in which orators use their bodies while they speak. is this, then, another piece of the argument about the bodily component of language?_]

- 1925. brains that are __inflamed__ by "ymagynacion" are, often, those whose owners contemplate the _devil_, and not __god__. there is a _hellish contemplation too_.

- 2005. the section has been discussing the __true meaning__ of the prepositions "in" and "up": one should interpret them as prepositions addressed to an inner capacity - non imaginative, non sensorial, non verbal. not phyisical instructions.

- 2100. the author further imposes the reader to avoid __imagining__ god and the _angels_ as having a body and a voice - but that is just fiction. the problem eventually is the very possibility of __vision__ - the things that cannot and should not be seen through our "bodely ighen."

	- that will __never__ be possible, since only Jesus was able to bring his body to heaven.

- 2173. again, the discussion about the possible use of __prepositions__ in divine discourse is crucial for this author - those cannot be used for spiritual beings. [_that is, god cannot be sitting on something; god cannot be found in a place. space, like time, is not applicable to divinity._]

- 2230. again, a description of the current status of ymagynation - a faculty that man has lost - that cannot be controlled anymore. today it flees from the control of __reason__; at times it becomes __fantasy__, which makes "a bodely conseyt of a goostly thing, or elles a goostly conseyte of a bodely thing." it is the faculty which allows for __personification__ and __allegory__ - dangerous, fake. [_this distinction is cardinal; imagination can still be used for safe purposes, but fantasy definitely cannot. the fact that a degraded version of imagination is introduced here perhaps explains why the author is still using images, from time to time - imagination can still have a legitimate - an ethically and epistemologically acceptable - function in contemplation. but fantasy cannot._]

- 2379. the author insists on the inability of the senses to reach the highest spheres.

- 2464. the conclusive paradox: the book itself, when experienced, is a genuine prompt to __contemplation__.
