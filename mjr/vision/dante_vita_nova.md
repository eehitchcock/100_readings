#Vita Nova di Dante Alighieri

##Introduction

- written around __1293__, as a way to "put ideas in place" - ordering his juvenile poems and giving them an overarching structure. __vita nova__ is looking backwards.

- but it is also looking forward: it is the attempt to establish a __new style__.

##Commentary

- i. the incipit is, of course, bookish - a __rubric__. the purpose is to make a smaller, more slender book out of a heavy one (or out of one of its sections).

- ii. periphrasis: nine time the sky of the sun had turned. the context is immediately __astronomical__, cosmic. beatrice (whose name is an adjective, a common noun recognizable by everuone) simply __appears__ in her earthly clothes.

	- the opening is __not allegorical__; it is the apparition of a physical, historical person, who prompts a physiological reaction in the body of the poet. __matter__.

	- of course, the "spirito de la vita" speaks __latin__, not dante's vernacular.

	- the physical apparition prompts the reaction of the spirits inhabiting dante's mind - there are four ("vita," "animale," "viso" - vision? - and "naturale"). they are __psychological actors__, governing his reactions - affective reactions - and talking to each other in latin.

	- from now on, love is his lord (just like in RdR); this is the first __allegorical__ presence. he now dominates him as a __tyrant__; but, since the object of this love is virtuous, reason agrees with it.

- iii. an episode: nine years later they meet again. the poet projects __allegorical meaning__ (symbolical? secondary meaning) onto __historical__ events and characters. __typology?__

	- here is the dream, the __vision__ after boethius. this time it is a __man__, and a master. "ego dominus tuus." the historical event (b.'s salute) prompts the allegorical vision. dante dreams that the woman is fed something that makes her sad - and he wakes up.

	- the object was dante's heart; this revelation is contained in the poem, that is itself contained in the prose. the episode is described as violent and horrifying.

	- two recurring elements accompany the verses: their __epistolary purpose__, and __paraphrasis__.

- iv. dante's use of allegory, so far, is a mixture of __psychological__ insight and __symbolical__ interpretation of _historical_ events. for now we have more __phenomenology__ than metaphysics.

- v. here we find the _memory of the woman as a __screen__; more allegorical history?

- vii. in this section we find a sonnet where __outward__ appearance (manifestation) and __inner__ feeling (suffering) are in _contrast_. like the screen and the woman, this could be a meditation on __primary__ (deceiving) and __secondary__ (hidden) meaning - __allegory__.

- viii. another encoded sonnet, for the the death of one of beatrice's friends. is this device __typology__ (figura)? does it anticipate b.'s death? the function is twofold: a general __meditation__ on death, and a message for those who can decypher it (epistolary enigma).

	- the snnet contained here presents several __allegorical personifications__: "amore," "pieta," "morte."

	- the two hermeneutical devices used by d. in his commentary are __division__ (in "parti") and __paraphrasis__.

	- the second poem here is a fine example of d.'s method. _history_ prompts _psychology_, then _allegory_.

- ix. a complex episode. d. is surrounded by friends, travelling, and he sees love as a pilgrim, walking next to him. the god (never named as such so far) instructs him to use a __new woman__ as his screen (defense): he has to employ his "simulato amore." then d. __absorbs__ him in himself.

- xi. here we have an __interpretation__ of the gesture of b.'s salute. it follows the customary pattern: historical event - psychological analysis (interaction of __spiriti__) and _allegory_.

	- allegory is, so far, a theory of human thought and affective world.

- xii. here we have a more explicitly boethian moment: d. is lonely and sad, weeping for the loss of the __salute__. he falls asleep (dream), and he sees a youth in a white robe. he is another incarnation of love; he speaks __latin__ - but dante does not understand what he means (cryptic language about the __perfect circle__). latin is an arcane __language of secrets__. the moment is solemn: love wants dante to unveil his secret (hidden) love, through a poem. the youth switches from __latin__ to __italian__. "fili mi, tempus est ut preterminctantur simulacra nostra." what follows is another epistolary poem, where the same "__ballata__" is sent to her as a token of his love.

- xiii. psychomachia as the __staging of doubt__ - d. is held by four contrasting thoughts regarding love. this section is _spatialization, psychomachia, allegory_. dante uses space and __personification__ as means to __dramatize__ his inner world.

	- these literary devices have become ways to __interpret his reality__.

- xiv. a simple episode is amplified in the __dramatization__ of psychological actors - the interior triggers of phenomena that become _socially readable_ - d. has no longer control over his outward reactions. notice that the _spirits_ now speak __italian__.

- xvi. the chronology of the feelings and writings described in this section is noteworthy. __thought__ (intellectual, affective) is followed by __poetic composition__, which is then followed by __prose__ (paraphrasis). _thought_ - (analogy?) _poetry_ - (analysis?) _prose_.

- xviii. this book is full of anonymous women - a public for d.'s behavior, complementing that of his literate friends. here d. explains how the salute was the place of all his happiness (boethian __fortune__ and fame), and now he has lost it. this section leads to the discovery of the __loda__ as a way to achieve beatitude.

- xix. here we find the notorious "donne ch'avete intelletto d'amore." __affective intellect__.

	- the poem contains the first __theological transfiguration__ of b.: an angel relates her extraordinary beauty (grace? virtue?) to the highest sphere. heavens claim her.

	- the _transfiguration_ is __typology__ (and only secondarily allegory): he is figura of human beatitude in the skies.

	- this is the discovery of the canzone - __indirect praise__ to god (and an acknowledgement of his superior faculty to regulate cosmic order).

	- the canzone mixes history, typology, allegory and psychology. beatrice as the "__cosa nova__."

- xx. the sonnet as a __philosophical form__: here we have an analysis of love and its domain.

- xxi. the new mode of d.'s poetry is philosophical and theological, praising her as a __virtue__.

- xxii. b.'s dad dies: this death is treated differently, from a more explicitly __christian perspective__. here the sonnets are used to reiterate the words spoken by b.'s friends, as a sort of __dialogue__. the topic is that of __transformation__ and _appearance_. beatrice's sight changes one.

- xxiii. here, fallen ill, the poet suffers in bed about the idea of the frailty of b.'s health. the poet, as in a vision, realizes that the woman is mortal. __visions__ here too (those of a feverish mind - hallucinations perhaps). the faculty is __fantasia__, who wonders (errare). this fantasy of b.'s death, prompting catastrophic reactions in the universe, is one of the most __imaginative__ moments of the book. it is also psychologically accurate - the sort of anxious thought that would really keep a lover awake. "tu se' morto."

- xxiv. the visions become more frequent. here we have one where the _nickname_ of one of d.'s acquaintances ("primavera") becomes a __signifier__ for one of b.'s attributes (she will be soon revealed; she will come soon). __history as figura; people as signs.__

- xxv. a small discussion of a potential ambiguity - love as an __allegorical personification__ could be confused with love as an __entity__ (inanimate), and therefore be __deceiving__. the philosophical contradicition is solved by appealing to classical authority (i.e., ovid).

- xxvi. a small episode becomes the quintessential __lode__ - "tanto gentile e tanto onesta pare." the woman's salute is an instrument for __theological and ethical ascent__, like the poem.

- xxviii. here we have the __death of beatrice__. dante will not, in this case, describe the _historical circumstance_. the book is shitfing from the material to the __celestial world__.

- xxix. the only historical datum is the date of her death, which becomes the object of a complex __translation__ to the _arab tradition_, in order to make it __nine__, her number.

- xxxi. the __division__ now anticipates the song; _the secondary meaning emerges from the primary?_

- xxxiv. the death of beatrice occupies an _almost metaphysical space_; but here we return (after a year) to the streets of florence, and its precise local circumstances. d. is drawing angels on some tablets, and two men discover him.

	- the poem, however, ignores these specific details; it has __two beginnings__ - one with love, the other with mary. the whole section deals with __mourning__ and its social perception.

- xxxvii. d. curses his eyes for finding too much enjoyment in another woman. he has to keep steadfast his leading thought, his __awareness__, his mourning. boethian __memento__.

- xxxviii. a new doubt, then - should the poet forget his grief, and pursue a new, __ephemeral happiness__? the mode to express it is, again, __psychological allegory__.

- xxxix. a __vision__ of beatrice calls the poet back; he bears the signs of suffering so much that his own appearance becomes __figura__, like that of a martyr (purple eyes - circles).

- Xl. the episode of the pilgrims, on their way to see the _impression of christ on the veil_. is it another allegory? dante wonders how they can live without knowing b.
	- two signs compared - the __image__ and the __historical person__; and the loss of _an entire city_.

- xli. the last sonnet is the complete, accomplished description of the __elevation__ achieved through the thought and the praise of beatrice. thus, by means of her, dante's "__sospiro__" reaches the spaces "oltre la spera che piu larga gira."

	- this is the first journey of a pilgrim that moves prompted by "__intelligenza nova__."

- xlii. here we have an anticipation of __commedia__, in the form of an _invocation to god_.
