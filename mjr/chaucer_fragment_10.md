#The Canterbury Tales - Fragment 10

##The parson in the general prologue

485. the portrait of this character seems unambiguously positive. the parson is a "good man [...] of religioun"; he is well learned and virtuous. the description sets up a __positive contrast__ between what the parson has - he is a poor man - and what he is. he might represent the perfect combination of __vita activa__ and __contemplativa__. many material similes - he was "riche [...] of holy thoght and werk"; and his favorite metaphor for the corruptibility of the soul was "that if gold ruste, what shal iren do?" [_a concrete image, like the ones used by julian._]

528. the parson is, in the end, a great teacher; he teaches through his wisdom, but also through his __example__ (skillful with words). is this a latent critique to traditional pedagogy - especially the __expository__, dialogical and poetical method of the consolations?

##The parson's prologue

12. the opening is an elaborate astronomical periphrasis for time. it is a solemn introduction; the poet uses his own body (first person singular) [_the remark seems trivial; as we will see, though, chaucer needs to be very present in this scene for the ending to make sense; he is merging with the parson_] as the measure of the day.

47. the parson immediately identifies an ethical stance and a literary place for his tale; he does not believe in the moral utility of tales, which distract the public from __truth__; and he does not use alliteration nor rhyme (which he seems to know well), but only __prose__ (this reminds us of the cl. of unk[nowing]).

	- the parson is humble - his tale should be edited (corrected) by a clerk [_just like the man of law's tale_] - and has a high theological mission - to turn this earthly pilgrimage into an 	__enlightening__ experience, towards jerusalem.

	- this might justify the solemnity of the opening periphrasis, a trope from dante [_transcendent pilgrimage_].

##The parson's tale

77. the opening is a quotation in latin, where the moral behavior of a christian soul is compared to the __right path__ that should be followed during a journey (pilgrimage?) [_langland, dante_].

100. the style is slow and simple. the parson wishes to be clear as he explains his argument - he wants to describe the path to forgiveness and salvation, whose first stage is __penitence__. he refers often to theological authorities of christianity.

	- one of his main concerns is __sincerity__ in the performance - it has to be genuine.

126. there are some devices that make the prose especially slow: one is the repetition of the last word of a sentence at the beginning of the following one - __anadiplosis__ as a cohesive device; the second is the __abundance of textual markers__ that will orient the reader: lists, summaries, prolexis and analexis.

	- chaucer is trying to make good prose - even though it is dull. chaucer is trying to be explicit. he uses a simile - confession is compared to a tree - to unpack, or slowly describe, the meaning and the procedure that lead to confession [_these trivial images are, again, a potential connection to julian_].

230. a long description of the eternal suffering that awaits sinners in hell takes much space in the exposition of repentance. fear seems a powerful strategy for the parson's rhetoric. he keeps using many holy sources.

315. the parson's homiletic exposition operates on the threshold between __affective and intellectual__ response. he tries to trigger a __feeling__ - he wants to teach how to respond to sin and contrition - by conveying __knowledge__.

	- he describes how we are supposed to feel, but he does not make us feel.
