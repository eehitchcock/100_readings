#The York Corpus Christi Cycle

##Introduction

- the feast was devoted to the __host__. pageants and plays were included to celebrate the __visible__ (tangible) manifestation of the __invisible__ (divine).

- one manuscript. one "unique survival of medieval theater." it is remarkable because it is (almost!) complete.

##Commentary

1. About the __creation__. the first stanza combines __anaphora__ and alliteration. god enters the stage. his first two lines are in __latin__. the rest of the work is a sort of __translation__, of _unfolding_. a constant __paraphrasis__ of this initial statement.

	- God creates the angels as his ministers. to have them stable in the thought of him. their song (in __latin__) is integrated in his monologue (in __english__); notice that he uses abundant __alliteration__. he makes lucifer his first __subordinate__.

	- lucifer too speaks in alliteration; and his flaw is immediately perceivable - __pride__.

	- alliteration eventually becomes a __mark of arrogance__

		- "o, what I am fetys and fayre and fygure full fyth"

	- the second "deficiens" angel uses even excessive alliteration. he tries to be __more godly than god__.

	- the whole first play actually works as a __degeneration of form__, through __alliteration__, until lucifer breaks the meter - his arrogance, his excess in the imitation of __god__ (ubris) leads him to violating the rules. language coincides with __orthodoxy__.

	- the break of meter coincides with the __fall__ - "owe, dewes, all goes downe." 

	- the play ends with another __monologue by god__ (balance). it is as if everything (the fall itself) could by reabsorbed by __divine providence__.

2. wonderful beginning, with two lines spoken in __latin__ and - alternatively - immediately coupled with an approximate english translation. the topic is the __creation of the world__. it is a long _monologue by god_, alone.

	- after a summary of __creation__, god starts describing and __naming__ the universe. but these two acts are __creative__; he has decided to "publysch my power."

	- we can suppose that, as he names these items (in english!), god is showing parts of the __stage__. perhaps the stage is what justifies the __vernacular__? [_the whole concept of corpus christi as an embodiment of the neoplatonic universe, a stage of degradation from eternity, to history, to the representation of history; from latin to english; from angels to actors._]

	- the meter is very irregular (apparently); but we find occasional alliteration and __paronomasia__. the words employed occasionally find an order; this order __mirrors__ the order of __nature__ [the correspondence between __nature and language__ - language as a given - is an idea that we could expand further, from AdL to the divine speech.]

3. god is now speaking in __stanzas__ that have _alternate rhyme_. he's presenting the __creation__ again.

	- creation has a flaw - its purpose is love, but no creature in it is capable of loving. therefore god creates man out of earth (and this origin is explained in its two reasons - to make men __humble__ and to remind them of _death_). [signs are in creation itself; reality has to be interpreted in the same way that scripture has to be interpreted.]

	- adam and eve of course follow god's speech, the pattern established by him (alternate rhyme). 

	- the whole piece is a celebration of __harmony__ (it ends with a blessing - an "amen".)

4. every piece summarizes the context at the beginning.

	- abundance of __deixis__ when god talks about the tree of knowledge - the actor points at the prop.

	- the piece has a very articulate __rhyming pattern__, mixing alternate and coupling rhymes. the three characters follow it obediently (a. and e. especially).

5. diabolus, on stage, prepares the fall of man. his speech resembles the previous section - at least in the complexh rhyme scheme; mut the meter is much more irregular (short and long lines). again, the idea of __degradation of language__ (not abrupt, but progressive). 

	- eve's first line in the piece is clasped by the devil's utterances (stychomitya).

	- this is the first actual dialogue in the entire collection - the first where we perceive actual __tension__.

	- eventually eve is persuaded by the snake; bad __rhetoric__ in performance. the spectators were probably worried about the circumstance. __persuasion__ is rendered as a transference of __rhymes__ from speaker to speaker (devil - eve; eve - adam). the sense is always that of __contagious degradation__ [_notice too that this is the very making of history. this is the moment in which the endless repetition, the endless self-being of the eternal divine peace, becomes history. it is a painful process, and it is inevitable. the spectators simply witness the tragedy that made time and mortality._]

	- notice how god's hail to adam mirrors the first interaction between eve and the devil. balance.

6. this piece expands on god's punishment; the angelus's words seem a __translation__ from the passage in genesis ("lyffe ay in sorowe," "thy barnes to bere with mekill wa"), whereas a. and e.'s reactions have a naturalistic quality, and shape the potential resentment against the episode felt by spectators and their contemporaries. [_the translation, therefore, is also an adaptation through time. it is as if the adam and eve depicted here already knew about the long lasting wave of resentment experienced by future generations. the entirety of time is happening in the complaints and the groans uttered by the two characters. their grief resonates towards us._]

7. angelus opens this piece by summarizing the previous ones; his focus is on the tenth part of creation that eventually turned out evil (as a form of __trial__). the story of cain and abel therefore becomes an __example__ of this - every man should sacrifice a tenth of what he makes to god.

	- cain's refusal to give a tenth of what he produces is both somewhat __comical__ and somewhat __reasonable__. [_again, it is the reaction of a contemporary - it is a contemporary way of understanding something that has been settled long ago. progressive degradation of time.]
	
	- [_besides, it is clear why we have to find cain reasonable. because cain is us, because we have to misunderstand reality in the same way he does. because we too are sinners._]

	- there is already something fascinating about this this side of __evil__ - less mechanical than lucifer falling for his pride.

	- cain even uses a __latin__ justification to reply to a __latin curse__. he is __clever__. [_again, we are him; and he is the seducer, the rhetorician, the sinner that we know outside and inside of us._]

	- the piece ends with the angel reassuring __cain__ - he will be marked, but not killed. cain survives, and walks away among men (the __actor too__). __typology dramatized__. the embodiment of evil walks here.

8. __god's voice__ (in alternate rhyme) opens the piece about _noah's ark_.

	- god often opens a piece with a __summary__ of the _context_ and the _purpose_.

	- the __shipwrites__ were in charge of this section - even __making the fictional ship__, on stage, with a fictional _noah_, is an instance of __typology__. god gives instructions on _how to build a good boat_. [_the corpus christi plays is this huge machine of interpretation. it is the triumph of typology and allegory because it is the signifier building its signified (or vice versa?); it is the enormous effort of a community building its heavenly mirror, its typological mirror, its eternal mirror, its ancestral mirror. this play works so well because god is now integrated into the process; god has become the patron, the instructor, the teacher, of the whole corpus christi._]

9. __bob and wheel__. noah's monologue (wonderful) describes both past and present - a new world will emerge, as predicted. [_form that includes time. translation that includes the translator. i - actor noah - am part of the future of this past - that of actor historical person._]

	- the core of the piece is the __contrast__ between noah, who knows and trusts the truth, and his __wife__ (who comically disagrees with him). __disbelief__: making lack of faith a _comical_ moment. (also, _misogyny_). [_interpretation and misinterpretation are on stage._]

	- the characters keep referring to time passing (days, months, centuries), in the span of a single piece. __flexible temporality__. the performance as a synecdoche of all time; as an approach to god's eternity (_boethian_). this sudden _acceleration_ creates an even more comical contrast with the wife's _slowness_.

	- noah uses __latin__ to speak about the rainbow; divine signs, divine language. "his segne." (290) [_this is the proof that latin is the sign of divinity, and that the whole stage is the laboratory of an interpretation - in case we needed more._]

10. abraham, the main character, presents the circumstance and the purpose. the first monologue is always a __set up__ of the _setting_.

	- asked to perform the supreme sacrifice, a. remembers that his son is "thyrty yere and more sin dele" - the age of christ - typology is stressed (the __performance__ being _figura_ of _figura_). [_again, the plays explore the very making of time, which is here aligned in a sort of endless mise en abyme. abraham and isaac are god and christ; abraham and isaac are us; we are god and christ, we are abraham and isaac, we experience now the final convergence of time._]

	- a number of familii are introduced in the biblical episode, perhaps as ways to show _doubt_ and _marvel_. (guiding the audience's responses). abraham's faith is never questioned.

	- the performance of the sacrifice seems incredibly easy - perhaps the anxiety regarding its halt is what produced a sense of __expectation__/anticipation in the audience. awaiting the familiar. [_this is the sense of history in the making, the sense of the inevitable completion of time, that can never be stopped - the tragedy that has to happen because we already know its ending._]

	- pedagogical function: teaching repentance by having isaac asking for absolution "in worke, in dede, and thought."

	- the whole play slowly __dilates__ time; it tries to stop an _inevitable deed_.

	- somehow, the very story of abraham is a performance - a fiction of a sacrifice.

11. the pharaoh speaks in an especially broken metre. but his purpose is reasonable: he just wants universal "pees."

	- the solution to the __expansion__ (demograohic) of the jewish tribe is a racist massacre.

	- constant sense of __performance__ in the stories form the old testament; moses is taught how to fake trick - to impress the pharaoh.

	- the sense in this very history is __trickery__, that stands for the real history of embodiment and redemption. [_in a way, therefore, this staging of a trick performed by moses is a justification for the tricks performed on stage right now; these two are part of this repetitive history of interpretation, the typological spires of history._]

	- after the tricks in front of the pharaoh, the plagues are simply related on stage by a sequence of messengers.

		- __acceleration of time__ in this sequence.

	- the old testament ends with the pharaoh drowning in the red sea, and invoking mohammed.

12. the new testament opens with the character of a __doctour__ explaining the contradiction of the historical circumstance: mankind lost salvation after the original sin, but mankind was also created for happiness. the birth of christ is historically __necessary__. the doctor interprets _prophecies_ in latin regarding the incarnation in mary's womb. he decyphers allegories and similes found in the bible, as a priest or a clerk.

	- in a way, it is as if this rift between old and new testament should require the mediation of __books__, of their perceivable presence. perhaps it is the theological complexity of the incarnation; perhaps it is the fact that here __providence__ - latin - is becoming __history__ - latin [_i think i meant english here; the alignment is interesting: providence is latin and it is the momentary enternal present of the divine omniscience; on the other hand, history - what is really the boethian "fatum" - is english, and that is the broken perception of casual temporality experienced by mankind._]. in any case, the doctor paves the way for mary's entrance.

	- the rest of the piece is the __middle english annunciation__, followed by elizabeth's visitation.

13. the piece opens with joseph's long monologue, a sudden shift to his human perspective. he presents his misery, from his old age to mary's sudden pregnancy. his resolve is to discover who the father is.

	- after a long dialogue, where both positions are unable to find an acceptable middle ground, joseph flees from mary "in this wildernesse"; the piece is dense with potential dichotomies (__physical and metaphysical__ realm), faith and reason, performance and history. perhaps joseph is simply unable to assimilate the __divine__ dimension into this sensual history. [_why is it sensual? nevertheless, i think that i was referring to joseph's remark about the angel being, in truth, a fellow in a costume; that is precisely the sense of dissociation between primary and secondary meaning, between fatum and providence. i cannot believe that we are the signs of an inscrutable divine order (or language)._]

14. joseph's description of the shack of nativity is rich in deixis and specific details; the text is certainly extremely aware of the contrast between open and closed spaces, and of their defining features. __space__ - the background - acquires __importance__ - both historical (realism of fiction) and symbolic (performance and typology) [_the premise is true; the consequences seem less convincing. is there more that we should say about this sudden emergency of the background, at the moment of nativity? embodiment perhaps requires this double awareness - this shack was a real shack, somewhere in palestine; and this shack here is fake, because history repeats itself - so that it is a really fake shack._]

	- joseph leaves the shack to seek light, and while he's absent jesus is born, and his birth causes light. jesus is small but wondrous - a "swete thing" on her "kne." [_beautiful passage. joseph is not there, either for conception of birth, because his obtuseness is a sign of human's inability to access the true mysteries of divinity. the intimacy between jesus and mary, instead, is endearing, and it triggers a true sense of jealousy. why were we left outside with joseph?_]

	- like mary before him, joseph prays the newborn with a sequence of anaphoric "_hayle_" [_again, now joseph is shaping the audience's reactions from their own perspective - obtuseness, inaccessibility, and the sincere admiration of faith._]

	- the piece ends with the two anumals heating and loving their lord, participating in nativity.

15. a group of shepherds interprets the sign - the shining star that was used to announce christ's birth. they sing and bring there humble gifts. the result is comical and endearing, and it regulates the audience's response to this "littil babe!"

16. herodes enters the stage with an excess of __alliteration__, an irregular metre and a long sequence of pagan deities. powerful tyrants like pharaoh and h. emulate (or parody?) god's orderly rule as presented in genesis.

	- herod too invokes mohammed; the three kings are instead converted by the signs and the prophecies. herod decides to trick them by performing the role of the friendly ruler.

	- sense of dramatic tension. like in a romance, the evil king decides to trick the three pious men in order to get information about the child.

	- the whole section concerns the __interpretation of a sign__ - the star.

	- a collective process of __interpretation__: _interpreters_ (__performers__ and, collectively, __critics__). [_this point is cardinal; the cycle as a collective machine for interpretation._] 

	- the kings misunderstand the horizontal signs (herode), but read correctly the __vertical__ one.

17. the jewish laws (the same old testament shown at the beginning, and now reiterated in an elegant monologue by a "presbiter") imposes that mary, being considered a defiled woman, should offer a sacrifice.

	- the piece includes the monologues of those jews who could read the signs in time, and properly.

	- this play has a wonderful metre and rhyme scheme (no alliteration).

	- welcoming the "blyssed babb."

	- rich in tropes: repetition, anaphora, and the contradiction of a creature "to great and to small." [_this play seems very good to look at elaborate poetic language in the series._]

18. joseph is always __old__ - he's a persistent presence in these pieces.

	- the piece presents an extraordinary __inversion__ - joseph is instructed about the flight to egypt, so that he is the informed character, not mary. the exchange is, therefore, occasionally comical: joseph does not know where egypt is (like the rest of the audience, probably - perhaps another joke about __performance__).

	- another elaborate rhyme pattern.

19. the tone of epic, again - the idea of the massacre of the innocents is suggested to herodes by one of his advisers, who remains anonymous. the piece insists on mohammed: compared to the rest of the section, it identifies arabs with evil jews, and good jews with christians.

20. the piece about j. and the doctor concerns, again, __interpretation__ - the doctors are busy reading the big books of the law; jesus does not need them. he knows the ten commendments by heart.

	- the episode seems trivial and small; everyday incident becomes like the books. [_unclear note here; perhaps i meant that even the trivial circumstances of history - here a kid lost and found - are incorporated in the larger design of providence, in the divine books of divine eternal present._]

21. the baptism of christ - the performance of the episode is a ritual and the instruction of a ritual, its clarification and, again, interpretation.

	- it is the performance of a performance. [_it is a ritual and a performance of the first ritual, which is also a ritual by default. affinities with noah's ark._]

22. the entrance of the diabolus is the memorable "make rome," with the actor treading from the audience onto the stage. he interrupts the rite - the performacnce - to start a new one.

	- repetition (formularity) is a persistent structural element in the sequence. stubborness. [_that is, the stubborness of non-believers like joseph, the doctors, and the devil. this formularity is the formularity of disbelief and misinterpretation._]

23. the transfiguration as the quintessential __interpretation__ - seeing something that will _make you understand_, that will make you believe, that is one with the truth. memories of b. [__boethius__], and a truly __visionary moment__. the apostles have to interpret the characters of the old testament and the new appearance of christ. a true "visioun," with light and clouds. [_perhaps a passage that should be compared with thomas' doubt - there jesus praised the other believers, those who had faith without seeing. here to see is a crucial part of belief, of faith in the invisible._]

24. three jews bring the adulteress on stage; like for the devil, we have an emphasis on the proximity of evil to our present.

	- this is simply a display of jesus's mercy and powers. [_the episodes are the adulteress and lazarus. tricks, again?_]

25. the play shows the __making of time__ and jesus' making of __history__ - the fulfillment of prophecy. like a director, here he stages the entrance into jerusalem.

	- the initial problem is the obtainment of the donkey, probably a real beast on stage.

	- the audience probably became the people of jerusalem in the fiction. a number of fictional citizens have understood very well _who he is_.

	- a pauper and a blind man are chosen as jesus' interlocutors. eventually the blidn man can __see the show__, participate in the privilege. zache climbs up on the tree to see j. better; the whole piece becomes a __triumph of vision__ (even in vocabulary). [_meditation on the role of sensorial experience in the
