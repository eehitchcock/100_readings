#De Planctu Naturae

- Alan of Lille (d. 1203)

- Prosimetrum; the function of poetry is that of displaying the perfect order of nature; and that of creating a sort of objective, perfectly crafted beauty that can arouse desire in the reader.

- The striking quality of the first _metrum_ is that of closely associating _grammar_ and _order_. The order of nature is the order of grammar.

- Then there is the whole aspect of desire; the presence of __Nature__, her description, the articulation of the various parts of her body in the first prose, is an attempt at eliciting an authentic desire in the reader.

- The text is, of course, about the regulation of heterosexual love; heterosexual and monogamous love. The parts regarding __animals__ and their behavior could be easily associated to the observation of animal sexuality in Ovid, and to the allegorical understanding of natural life in bestiaries (after the _Physiologus_).

- Prescribing desire.
