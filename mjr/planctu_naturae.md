#De Planctu Naturae

##From the introduction (by Wintrhop Wetherbee)

###Author

- Born at Lille (Northern France), around 1120;
- __Doctor universalis__ of the _liberal arts_ (__7__) - between the Loire valley and Chartres (centre France)
- Taught in Paris, spent time in Provence (never left France, apparently);
- His epitaph: _Alanum breuis hora breui tumulo sepeliuit | Qui duo, qui septem, qui totum scibile sciuit._ (__duo__: the _Testaments_; __septem__: the _artes_);
- According to this preface, he was __Perhaps the most important Latin poet of his day_
- -- an innovative theologian and one of the founders of systematic theology --
- -- an apologist who attacked the Cathars and Waldensians and defended Christianity against Jews and Muslims -- (this guy is terrible)
- the author of a __treatise on preaching__ and a __manual for confessors__ that are __among the first of their kind__ (this is important business)
- his diverse writing are __unified by a theologian's concern with the relations between nature and the divine and with the problem of expressing these relations in language__;
- _the intellectual was emerging as a social type_;
- a universe that was essentially that of Plato's _Timaeus_, as interpreted by Calcidius, Macrobius, and the anonymous author of the Hermetic _Asclepius_;
- Alan's model of the physical universe, though it reflects a sophisticated appreciation of the cosmological thought of his mentors, is in the end simple and conventional. His emphasis is on its moral and spiritual implications, and he keeps both ancient science and the Neoplatonism of the late antique interpreters of Plato at a distance.

###The work

- written no later than the 1160s, when Alan was perhaps teaching in one of the cathedral schools;
- "survives in more than one hundred manuscripts [...] widely read throughout medieval Europe"
- indebted to __Bernardus Silvestris__ and his _Cosmographia_ (wonderful title) of 1147;
- "From Bernardus, and from their great common exemplars, Boethius and Martianus Capella, Alan learned to cast complex intellectual issues in literary form, and his career as a poet was largely defined by a sustained dialogue with the _Cosmographia_;
- "The _De Planctu Naturae_ is closely engaged with a world where language itself and hence poetry as well have lost the power to express natural love and the values implicit in the order of nature. Poetic language conveys the effect of the corruption of human nature in the form of bizarre rhetoric, obscene puns , paradox, and ambiguity, and this crisis creates a corresponding crisis in the level of poetics." (this is a very nice and quick takeaway - breaking of form, breaking of an ethical world of values)
- deeply indebted to Boethius as well.
- "Its divine Nature is a largely autonomous power whose laws govern the reproduction of created life and provide a standard for social and moral order."
- Alan's personified Nature is inherited from the _Cosmographia_ of Bernardus Silvestris.
- "That the forces essential to human survival are capable of undermining human self-realization is the central issue in the _De Planctu Naturae_. Nature's lament is an existential counterweight to the authoritarian idealism of Boethius's Philosophy, a sad answer to Philosophy's wish that the love that orders the heavens might govern the human spirit."
	- Crucial description of a __conflict__ which we should try to understand better. Sexuality seems to be a part of nature, but also one of its enemies. A natural, primitive force.
- "Nature then appears, and vicious troping is replaced by a luminous prose description of the goddess and her raiment, but the tortured elegiacs of the proem have revealed a paradox that will become more obvious as the dialogue proceeds. In establishing an __equivalence__ between __

###Commentary

- Prosimetrum; the function of poetry is that of displaying the perfect order of nature; and that of creating a sort of objective, perfectly crafted beauty that can arouse desire in the reader.

- The striking quality of the first _metrum_ is that of closely associating _grammar_ and _order_. The order of nature is the order of grammar.

- Then there is the whole aspect of desire; the presence of __Nature__, her description, the articulation of the various parts of her body in the first prose, is an attempt at eliciting an authentic desire in the reader.

- The text is, of course, about the regulation of heterosexual love; heterosexual and monogamous love. The parts regarding __animals__ and their behavior could be easily associated to the observation of animal sexuality in Ovid, and to the allegorical understanding of natural life in bestiaries (after the _Physiologus_).

- Prescribing desire.
