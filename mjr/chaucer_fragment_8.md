#The Canterbury Tales - Fragment 8

##The second nun in the prologue

164. we know very little about herl she is the prioress' "chapleyne," and walks with three priests.
	
	- the prioress, as a reinder, is frivolous and simple; she is vane, and sentimental.

##The prologue of the second nun's tale

28. we have no narrative introduction for this tale; only this prologue, where the nun describes her project: she will tell the life of __seint cecilie__, "mayde and martyr," whith the purpose of distancing her listeners from the __mortal vice of sleuthe__.

	- the metre is rime royale. the issue seems topical: vita __activa__ and __contemplativa__.

119. the rest of the prologue seems equally topical. we have an invocation to mary that starts with a close paraphrasis of dante; then we find an etymology of cecilia's name; that is broken into several possible ways, all accepted by the poet. the options that we have to interpret this __name__ correspond to her many virtues. [_you can think about will's many names in piers plowman._]

168. a wonderful opening. chaucer uses hagiography as a solemn genre, hieratic and precious; the gestures and the words flow slowly, the metre is long and it never breaks into enjambement (or into irregular lines). the maiden has to persuade her husband that she will stay a virgin, and she describes the - false? - protection of an angel. a miracolous intervention that is - so far - only __fiction__. is it faith?

	- what is the connection between __seeing__ and __believing__, if we consider faith?

	- the husband wants to to see the angel, like the characters in the __york gospel__ - like joseph. [_a good take on the genre of dream vision, then; the alternation between different levels of perception, and the problem of their connection to faith._]

241. cecilia sends her husband to urban, so that he might convert himself. he does; and afterwards he enters the realm of __vision__. he is now able to see the angel that follows cecilia; a __third person narration__ of a vision. something extraordinary for this genre.

	- the instrument of conversion is "a book with lettre of gold in honde" - as if the husband entered the world of the book as a portal.

266. the husband's brother cannot see, but only __smell__ the miracolous __flower crowns__; the brother explains that true __vision__ is __reality__, not dream, because "in dremes [...] han we be | unto this tyme." the twist to the genre is truly the way in which we adopt the __visionary__ perspective of a character described in the third person singular. we might share his new sight.

329. after a quotation from saint ambrose, translated into the middle english rime royale and discussing the conversion of both the husband and the brother [_it is a sort of documentary source_], we discover that the brother refuses to be converted for fear of being burned as a heretic. two contrasting speeches.

	- tiburce is eventually convinced by __theological truths__ explained to him by cecilia; she starts with trinity. after his conversion, he "every day saugh in tyme and space | the angel of god."

	- again, __knowledge__ (here the canonical teaching by cecilia [_founded on the scriptures and on theological authorities, like augustine, who often discussed the trinity_] is the way to conversion. [_cecilia becomes the sort of teacher found in visionary texts; she is the interlocutor of the dreamer, the guide; she is perhaps also a double for the teller of the story, the mysterious second nun who is instructing her audience._]

413. miracle and tragedy, the saint is able to form a group of converted christians around her; but they are betrayed and slaughtered.

	- their souls are seen ascending towards heaven.

511. the dialogue between cecilia and her accuser follows the mode of the __maieutic__ dialogue found in other dream visions, but also the holy trials of the gospels. the pattern remains the same - the skeptical learner, the enlightened leader. here cecilia has become a __personification__ of theological wisdom (like pearl or beatrice); she questions the accuser's authority and his true power. one of the problems is the conflict between earthly __senses__ (vision especially) and the higher awareness granted by divine truth. [_the whole tale, therefore, could be read as a reported dream vision, a third person dream vision._]

553. the ending is bloody; placed in a burning bath, the saint dies slowly of the wounds inflicted onto her by her tormentors. her house eventually becomes a __church__. like christ in the york cycle, she becomes a __sign__, a _signifier_, through her body and silence.

##The canon yeoman in the prologue

- there are neither canon nor his yeoman in the general prologue. not useful.

##The canon yeoman's prologue

614. the canon and his yeoman join the company only now. their description is purely __physical__; some details about their clothing, but the real focus is on the __sweat__, frothy and unstoppable, on their faces and their horses. two __exhausted bodies__.

	- the first dialogue is with the yeoman, the worker, who introduces his master.

719. a canon is an __alchemist__; the yeoman is a servant and an apprentice. the master lets him speak for him; he starts by praising the profession, but soon the host manages to make him confess; they do not know the science yet. alchemy is described as a __physical quest__; pale faces, metals, poverty and sweat. __labor of illumination__. [_the contrast between this tale and the previous one seems based on the juxtaposition of two levels of vision and intellectual research; the pure vision of contemplation and pure logic, as in cecilia, and the complete reliance on materiality, handled and exhausted, seen here._]

##The canon yeoman's tale

818. the opening of the tale is a long list of __matters__ - the elements and ingredients, of every sort, that have been employed for the alchemical research. it is a tale of __consumption and exhaustion__; things used to achieve the higher goal. this material focus reminds us of the sweat and froth of the opening. __labor and matter__.

930. a long description of the labor itself - it is a sort of material substitute of an intellectual method - it is an __experimental__ method, in a way. chaucer seems to acknowledge this, by having the yeoman expose his knowledge of astrology and the elements. and the description of these characters' devotion reveals a genuine motivation - they believe in what they are doing, they sacrifice everything for their research. they grow poor and attract the people's scorn. the description of the pot exploding involves the __devil__. some of these lists of matters and stones may refer to the __tradition of lapidaries and bestiaries__.

	- words become items; it is also an exposition similar to saint cecilie's teachings.
