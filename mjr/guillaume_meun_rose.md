#Guillaume de Lorris and Jean de Meun, Roman de La Rose

##Introduction

- the book, as the title implies, combines the __allegorical tradition__ of m. capella with the _romans_ written by chretien (esp. "conte du graal").

- j. de meun picked a title for his continuation: "le miroir aux amoureaux."

	- between the two works there is a __40 years interval__ (~__1235__ and ~__1275__).

##Commentary


- 1-20. dreams are real; this was said by __macrobius__, and this the poet knows for sure.

- 21-44. the topic of the book, therefore, is a dream that the poet had when he was twenty; but this _romans_, besides, contains everything that should be known about "l'art d'amours."

- 84. the setting: may - spring - and the _awakening of nature_. here the dream begins.

	- a note of clashing realism - the first action of the dream is to wake up and wash.

- 130-138. having followed the course of a stream, the dreamer finds an __enclosed garden__, bounded by decorated walls with __images__ that he starts to describe. __ekphrasis__.

- 139. the walls contain __allegorical personifications__; the first one is _haine_ (hatred).

- 169. one of the allegories depicted here is _greed_ (convoitise); these are now __vices__.

	- follows _avarice_ - doubling the liturgical/canonical vice. the images acquire realism and detail as the poet describes them - they become tridimensional.

- 279. the poet plays with the _depth_ of the _ekphrasis_ - which is, for envy, clearly a _flat_ "peinture." envy cannot, apparently, be perceived completely.

- 370. these descriptions are colorful and lively; verbs and adjectives express a sense of dynamism and tactile presence. here, besides, _viellece_ (old age) prompts a fascinating meditation on time - that which cannot be stopped. neither in paintings?

	- "un ymage ot apres escrite." this is a __procession__, a sequence readable in order.

- 465. a strange detail: the background (or the __texture__) of the images is "a or et a asur."

- 496. the "vergiers" is a triumph of __nature and sound__ (related): birds sing beautifully.

	- the poet sets a contrast between them and the _silent images_.

- 525. a beatiful woman - identified with the small access separating the garden from the wall. her beauty works precisely in this way - as a contact between the _silent world of culture_ and the _lively world of nature_. a detailed ekphrasis follows, freexing her on the page. the purpose seems that of __prompting desire__ in the reader.

- 621. we learn that the beautiful woman is "oiseuse", the owner of the garden is "deduis."

- 763. Having followed "une petite seinte" (715), we find deduis in her space (__spatialization__ is already a crucial topic/formal device in this text).

	- here we have __dances__ and music. it looks like the realm of _sensual enjoyment_.

- 801. new __allegorical personifications__ (as a carole). the poet joins the dance. the model is again that of a __procession__, a _readable sequence_. but these characters move. (however, the _ekphrasis_ keeps playing with _stasis_ - "il ressemblait une peinture")

- 903. enters the "diex (god) d'amors"; he is a representatitve of _lively_, colorful, sensuous nature (birds and flowers accompany him). _an excess of nature? or its secret force?_

- 985. around the god of love, we have the allegorical personifications that constitute its attributes or helpers: five positive and five negative. this is already different from the model of the procession - it is a __hierarchy__, perhaps a _taxonomy_. through these characters, the poet conveys an ehtical judgment - perhaps an __argument__.

- 1190. generally these a. p. present both __allegorical__ and __historical__ traits - their features are both signs standing for ideas associated to them, and details that would be realistically concurrent with these traits and ideas. they are between _symbols_ and _types_.

- 1251. yet, in these descriptions of positive qualities, there is still the sense of a __fixed sequence__, a necessary order. so that "la bele ouseuse __vint apres__." procession.

	- the personifications __show themselves__ in a meaningful order; no active reader.

- 1361. here we find a sequence of lists, comprising all sorts of _plants and fruits_ in an __encyclopedic fashion__. the garden apparently holds specimens for all nature.

	- it is another triumph of the senses, expressed through __vocabulary__. a lexical feast.

- 1439. the description of the garden becomes the story of narcissus, who died there - as reminded by "lectres petites" - an inscription on the deadly fountain.

- 1507. the ovidian story is retold without any special twist; but the poet asks the reader to __learn__ from the example ("dames cest exemple aprenes"); woman reader.

- 1580. the description dwells on the __reflection__ produced by a series of mirrors placed apparently __around__ the garden. mirrors are a new optical object which the poet incorporates in his space - they allow for _love_ and _knowledge_.

- 1655. the poet sees a __rose__ more alluring than the rest - its smell and color are enticing and fresh. _is it a vision?_ the poet is pushed back by the thorns.

	- the question being - why does this description follow the one of the __mirrors__?

- 1720. as he was approaching the rose, the poet is pierced by an arrow shot by the god of love. we see the usual trajectory here: from the eye to the heart.

- 1776. the episode is lively and almost funny: the poet tries to approach the rose (which is more and more suggestive, small, soft, and perfumed) three times, and three times he gets shot by love's arrows. the allegory becomes engrossing through these __inventive__ details; they are surprising (miracula) and entertaining.

- 1884. the poet has become a __slave__ (servant) of love. the two characters speak.

	- two notes:

		1. __smell__ is surprisingly predominant in this section;

		2. the style is __redundant__.

- 1993. the language used to describe this relationship of __subordination__ is that of _political subordination_ and even __imprisonment__. it is a dialogue between slave and master.

- 2055. after having locked the poet's heart, thus becoming a _jailer_, amors starts talking lieke a teacher. __jailer and instructor__ - this could be a weird take on boethius.

- 2232. this section contains a long sequence of simple ethical instructions, in the imperative mode, retold as __conditions__ to please love. they arent' surprising.

	- __love__ is _the greatest imperative_ - he wants the poet to constantly think about him. this will prompt a series of "aventures" (2267) related in the _future tense_.

- 2327. "soupirs, espointes et fricons": love describes the future __symptoms__ that the poet will experience as if they were extremely conventional; __literary motives__.

- 2504. here amor plays the role of the lover, and has an entire speech (within his own __large speech__!) relating his feelings. is this a single __performance__?

- 2549. the poet eventually speaks back; his question is _how do lovers withstand so much?_

- 2765. after having described the joys of love (_hope_ is the main one), love simply disappears.

- 2827. __names__ structure the allegory. allegorical personifications who stand for both the poet's perceptions and feelings (__subjective__) and for his material surroundings (__objective__). here we have "bel acuel" and "dangiers," one facilitating and the other blocking the poet's access to the rose. the _secondary meaning_ (the poet falling in love) is replaced by an entirely fictional __narrative__ (the garden).

- 2975. a lady in her tower stops the quarrel between the poet and his enemies; she is "raison," another allegorical figure. apparently she will rescue the poet from his anxiety.

- 3072. but reison's request is surprisingly harsh. she asks the poet to __stop his love__.

	- "tu dois metre force et deffense | encontre ce que tan cuer perse."

- 3101. the problem now seems to be the role of __will__ in __love__; can we really control it? _is it deliberate?_

- 3145. the friend (an allegorical friend?), "amis," suggests that the poet should _convince dangiers_.

- 3246. a new suggestion by _amis_ (the first failed). _the poet should try to look pitiful._ human actors (not nature).

- 3324. dangiers is finally persuaded by a __group of allegories__; he will let the lover pass.

- 3360. the rose has expanded - it is now bigger, more colorful, more perfumed, more __alluring__.

- 3411. the poet wishes to obtain a kiss, but there is a _new obstacle_: "chastae." allegorical __seduction__.

- 3440. here we have a new character, a female warrior fighting against chastity, to help the suitor win. she is __venus__ - "la mere aud dieu d'amors." the poet is playful towards paganism.

- 3487. __smells__ have an extraordinary importance in the poem. the kiss is here entirely olfactory.

	- vision, smell, and hearing, with smell being associated with __pure sensuality__. a theory of the senses?

- 3601. here we have the beginning of a new section: after having enjoyed the kiss, the poet has to face "malebouche" (gossip), "honte," "jalousie," and more _social enemies_.

- 3713. the social enemies (they are the forces of pruderie and sexual restraint) go visit "dangier," to blame him for the _forbidden kiss_. characters change roles and spatial positions; it is a sort of __psychological treatise__, in the form of a _narrative_.

- 3762. _dangiers becomes the hunter_, the main antagonist. he is looking for the poet and his lover, probably to capture and stop them. more __dramatization__ of a simple affair.

- 3910. a long and detailed description of the fortification that jalousie builds now around the garden, helped by the rest of the social enemies.

	- the poet is apparently prescribing more than just unrestrained love; he argues for a __specific kind of love__.

- 3980. the poet laments his state in the __present tense__: vivid threat. the siege has elements of _epic_.

	- as if the poet's mission was a quest or a huge battle. with this lament __guillaume ends__.

- - -

- 4099. the style of __jean de meun__ is more elaborate (higher?); he uses polysyllabic words more often, and the rhyme is often feminine. in any case, he diligently continues.

- 4224. here ends the monologue of the poet's complaint, in the present tense, completed by jean.

- 4358. __raison__ speaks. her description of love is the customary sequence of __oxymora__.

	- it is poetycally striking, but it works as an ethical admonition - __love is not pleasant__.

- 4420. the following section of the speech is a __scientific__, cold description of the phenomenology and _social_ or _biological_ function of love. eventually reason names _nature_ (another allegorical personification?): she uses love as a means to ensure __procreation__ (AdL is here).

- 4628. reason concludes her argument _against love_; she includes a broader discourse about _jonece_ and _vielece_ (one serves "delit," the other "mort"). it is an __allegorical argument__.

- 4782. reason goes on by praising different, __commendable types of love__: the first one is friendship.

- 4895. reason now discusses __fortune__ and its wheel - it shouldn't be loved. boethian wisdom.

- 5091. the speech shifted from love to __fortune__ (subjective), to a general discussion of __vices in society__. reason lists and scorns social categories of avid, wicked people.

- 5375. through fortune and its discussion, the speech slowly departed from its original focus - love; and even the poet seems different now. he is behaving like a __disciple__, a budding philosopher, not like a lover. his questions are now about __thinkers__.
	
	- the previous dreamer wished to __do__ - a practical problem; this one wishes to __know__: intellectual.

- 5763. the debate has become an __intellectual__ discussion about love. after having presented and juxtaposed the opinions of established latin writers (a sort of _compendium/compilatio_), the character and the teacher discuss "natural love," that which prompts beasts

- 6023. this has clearly become something else - a __philosophical or ethical treatise__, written in the form of an allegorical poem. raison keeps discussing __fortune__; her speech uses quotations and examples of _classicity_, and allegories and tropes, like now.

- 6155. the __palace of fortune__: reason is using _spatialization_ as a way to explain her point.

- 6355. this section works as a poetical expansion of renown motives; here we have nero and seneca (they were already part of the boethian catalogue), incorporated into allegory.

- 7153. in this section (which this edition names "les mots et les choses"), raison explains theories of __language and interpretation__, from verbal signs to allegory. the transition is thematically striking, but probably not that abrupt: the dreamer is learning that the __rose__ which he pursued is, in fact, not a true prize - deceit.

	- therefore, if we understand this properly, the poet has been tricked by his own allegory.

	- love and allegory are dangerous fictions, as they can similarly __deceive__.

- 7236. here ends the long speech by __raison__; lost and perhaps only partially wiser, the dreamer finds some __advice__ in "ami," who wants him to forget the rose.

- 7463. the most genuinely entertaining section of JdM so far - the __performance of contrition__. here "amis" is teaching the reader how to _fake tears_.
	
	- this works as an _expansion_ and a _reversal_ of guillaume's phenomenology of love.

- 7903. the "ami" is using spatialization as well: to explain his ethical precepts he describes good and bad paths, and the ideas found there (positive and negative). __paths__ as _ethical methods_.

- 8561. following the pattern established for raison, _ami_ too prepares a speech that develops surprisingly from love to a __wider social meditation__; including thinkers.

	- the discourse takes a mysogynistic turn, using many classical authorities and exempla.

- 9165. the discourse becomes so ferociously mysogynistic that we might start doubting its authenticity. it is an __explosion__ more than expansion, an idea led to its extremes.

- 9270. we eventually perceive that the theme is still performance: __women are performers__.

	- this explains the abundant descriptions of their clothes and accessories: all fake.

- 9587. another kind of expansion - this time chronological: the speech moves from the falsity of present society to the transparent rules of the golden age, and the history of society through its __increasing vices__. allegory is _contagious_; the method, __associative__.

- 10060. after the end of amis' long speech, the poet wanders in a new luxurious wood, until he finds __richesse__ and her family. the poet's quest is still the same: free the rose from the castle.

	- richesse has some insight knowledge about the tower and its inhabitants.

- 10300. instructed by all these characters, the dreamer becomes a __servant__ of love, a __supplicant__ at the tower. he has to use some of his new knowledge to act appropriately.

- 10439. the tone of __epic__ returns here, as the dreamer decides to prepare a __siege__ against the tower, with love.

	- the characters who previously lived in the garden now form an army to assault the prison.

- 10565. jean de meun and guillaume de lorris are invoked in this same section; they are part of the army of love - fighters in a tradition that includes the _roman love singers_ (catullus, ovides). they have preserved the fiction of love; made it possible.

	- the section then becomes a __democratic debate__ about whether __jdm__ could complete the book or not.

- 11222. the character of fausemblant speaks for a long time about the ways in which he could - or could not - be employed by love. appearing what you are not and learning how to __fake__ your intentions - the book treats this ambiguously.

- 11525. the debate has now incorporated __religious speech__, clergy, scripture - and the devil.

	- this section is a sort of general __invective__ against the _degradation of ethos_ in society.

- 12977. a large section is devoted to "la vielle," a __type__, an __allegorical personification__, and a character. she is the experienced, perhaps jaded, former lover; advising the poet.

- 15890. the poem becomes an __epic collective battle__ against the _keeper of the rose_; but now it discusses nature - the working assistant of god. nature keeps the world running.

	- the section seems to absorb and translate alain, with genius, and her complaint.

- 17000. the poem about love has become a poem about everything - now it discusses the order of the __universe__, the motion and the music of the spheres.

	- eventually the exposition covers boethian problems as well, such as __free will__.

- 18080. later the speech becomes a __scientific discussion__ of _natural phenomena_, which incorporates classical thinkers and naturalists, as well as pagan figures and motives.

	- from natural phemomena, jean moves to _mirrors and illusions_. __appearance and deceit__ seem to be his strongest focus, even when dealing with the physical world.

- 21720. eventually, wiser with all the previous exposition (humanity, free will and the order of the cosmos), the poet has access to the rose - and he fully enjoys it.
