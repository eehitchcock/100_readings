#Guillaume and Jean de Meun, Roman de La Rose

##Introduction

- the book, as the title implies, combines the __allegorical tradition__ of m. capella with the _romans_ written by chretien (esp. "conte du graal").

- j. de meun picked a title for his continuation: "le miroir aux amoureaux."

	- between the two works there is a __40 years interval__ (~__1235__ and ~__1275__).

##Commentary


- 1-20. dreams are real; this was said by __macrobius__, and this the poet knows for sure.

- 21-44. the topic of the book, therefore, is a dream that the poet had when he was twenty; but this _romans_, besides, contains everything that should be known about "l'art d'amours."

- 84. the setting: may - spring - and the _awakening of nature_. here the dream begins.

	- a note of clashing realism - the first action of the dream is to wake up and wash.

- 130-138. having followed the course of a stream, the dreamer finds an __enclosed garden__, bounded by decorated walls with __images__ that he starts to describe. __ekphrasis__.

- 139. the walls contain __allegorical personifications__; the first one is _haine_ (hatred).

- 169. one of the allegories depicted here is _greed_ (convoitise); these are now __vices__.

	- follows _avarice_ - doubling the liturgical/canonical vice. the images acquire realism and detail as the poet describes them - they become tridimensional.

- 279. the poet plays with the _depth_ of the _ekphrasis_ - which is, for envy, clearly a _flat_ "peinture." envy cannot, apparently, be perceived completely.

- 370. these descriptions are colorful and lively; verbs and adjectives express a sense of dynamism and tactile presence. here, besides, _viellece_ (old age) prompts a fascinating meditation on time - that which cannot be stopped. neither in paintings?

	- "un ymage ot apres escrite." this is a __procession__, a sequence readable in order.

- 465. a strange detail: the background (or the __texture__) of the images is "a or et a asur."

- 496. the "vergiers" is a triumph of __nature and sound__ (related): birds sing beautifully.

	- the poet sets a contrast between them and the _silent images_.

- 525. a beatiful woman - identified with the small access separating the garden from the wall. her beauty works precisely in this way - as a contact between the _silent world of culture_ and the _lively world of nature_. a detailed ekphrasis follows, freexing her on the page. the purpose seems that of __prompting desire__ in the reader.

- 621. we learn that the beautiful woman is "oiseuse", the owner of the garden is "deduis."

- 763. Having followed "une petite seinte" (715), we find deduis in her space (__spatialization__ is already a crucial topic/formal device in this text).

	- here we have __dances__ and music. it looks like the realm of _sensual enjoyment_.

- 801. new __allegorical personifications__ (as a carole). the poet joins the dance. the model is again that of a __procession__, a _readable sequence_. but these characters move. (however, the _ekphrasis_ keeps playing with _stasis_ - "il ressemblait une peinture")

- 903. enters the "diex (god) d'amors"; he is a representatitve of _lively_, colorful, sensuous nature (birds and flowers accompany him). _an excess of nature? or its secret force?_

- 985. around the god of love, we have the allegorical personifications that constitute its attributes or helpers: five positive and five negative. this is already different from the model of the procession - it is a __hierarchy__, perhaps a _taxonomy_. through these characters, the poet conveys an ehtical judgment - perhaps an __argument__.

- 1190. generally these a. p. present both __allegorical__ and __historical__ traits - their features are both signs standing for ideas associated to them, and details that would be realistically concurrent with these traits and ideas. they are between _symbols_ and _types_.

- 1251. yet, in these descriptions of positive qualities, there is still the sense of a __fixed sequence__, a necessary order. so that "la bele ouseuse __vint apres__." procession.

	- the personifications __show themselves__ in a meaningful order; no active reader.

- 1361. here we find a sequence of lists, comprising all sorts of _plants and fruits_ in an __encyclopedic fashion__. the garden apparently holds specimens for all nature.

	- it is another triumph of the senses, expressed through __vocabulary__. a lexical feast.

- 1439. the description of the garden becomes the story of narcissus, who died there - as reminded by "lectres petites" - an inscription on the deadly fountain.

- 1507. the ovidian story is retold without any special twist; but the poet asks the reader to __learn__ from the example ("dames cest exemple aprenes"); woman reader.

- 1580. the description dwells on the __reflection__ produced by a series of mirrors placed apparently __around__ the garden. mirrors are a new optical object which the poet incorporates in his space - they allow for _love_ and _knowledge_.

- 1655. the poet sees a __rose__ more alluring than the rest - its smell and color are enticing and fresh. _is it a vision?_ the poet is pushed back by the thorns.

	- the question being - why does this description follow the one of the __mirrors__?

- 1720. as he was approaching the rose, the poet is pierced by an arrow shot by the god of love. we see the usual trajectory here: from the eye to the heart.

- 1776. the episode is lively and almost funny: the poet tries to approach the rose (which is more and more suggestive, small, soft, and perfumed) three times, and three times he gets shot by love's arrows. the allegory becomes engrossing through these __inventive__ details; they are surprising (miracula) and entertaining.

- 1884. the poet has become a __slave__ (servant) of love. the two characters speak.

	- two notes:

		1. __smell__ is surprisingly predominant in this section;

		2. the style is __redundant__.

- 1993. the language used to describe this relationship of __subordination__ is that of _political subordination_ and even __imprisonment__. it is a dialogue between slave and master.

- 2055. after having locked the poet's heart, thus becoming a _jailer_, amors starts talking lieke a teacher. __jailer and instructor__ - this could be a weird take on boethius.

- 2232. this section contains a long sequence of simple ethical instructions, in the imperative mode, retold as __conditions__ to please love. they arent' surprising.

	- __love__ is _the greatest imperative_ - he wants the poet to constantly think about him. this will prompt a series of "aventures" (2267) related in the _future tense_.

- 2327. "soupirs, espointes et fricons": love describes the future __symptoms__ that the poet will experience as if they were extremely conventional; __literary motives__.

- 2504. here amor plays the role of the lover, and has an entire speech (within his own __large speech__!) relating his feelings. is this a single __performance__?
