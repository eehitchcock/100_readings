#Amis e Amilun

##Introduction

- written in the late xii century. versions of this story exist everywhere on the continent.

	- the anglo-norman one is one of the earliest. it may be based on an actual historical event.

- according to this commentator - judith weiss - the two characters here stand for one. it is, again, the pervading theme of the __double__. "semblant e fet" - appearance and fact - is the leading idea of the poem. the two appear identical, but can't be substituted.

- it has survived in three ms. one is a consistently different version, probably influenced by the middle english poem. the other two date from the xiii and late xiii s.

- the poet tried to play down the continental colouring of the poem. __insularization__.

- there is some overlapping with _horn_ [_the anglo-norman roman_] in the treatment of the two female figures.

##Comment

46. in this first few lines the poet presents his story and his work to the audience - he found this story "set down in writing" - and the peculiarities of its two main characters. these love each other; they are __identical and beautiful__. they have good relationships with the king.

150. a __separation__ occurs. amilun has to return to his lands, to look after them after the death of his father. he warns amis against the evil seneschal and against __sin__.

	- friendship is treated as a sort of __alliance__; the seneschal asks amis to replace amilun with him.

250. the narrative standpoint now moves freely between the two characters. it establishes __parallels__ between them, so much that we might __confuse__ them - amilun decides to marry a beautiful count's daughter in his land, while in his own land amis becomes the love object of another count's daughter, who falls ill after hearing the news about his __exceptional beauty__.

	- they are able to meet, indeed, because amis falls ill too.

312. alone in the palace - all the men are hunting - amis and florie meet. she threatens to have him killed if she does not sleep with her; he is forced to agree (what he fears is to betray the trust of his lord). they will keep their arrangement secret, but someone hears them.

462. the seneschal has discovered their secret affair. after having witnessed their sexual encounter, he denounces them to the count.

	- the count's fury against his daughter - repeatedly called a whore - and amis - considered a rapist - is almost shocking. he turns "blacker than coal with anger and fury" [_wrath is a strong component in this romance; think about the conclusion as well; the idea is probably that the deception of appearances leads to violence and conflict; it is also a very dark poem_].

	- amis finds himself paralized in a dilemma; he could be the prototypical man mistreated by __history__.

	- he decides to ride towards amilun, to ask for his help. male friendship and the dangers of __desire__. [_what if this was actually a story about translation? a story about the dangers of substitution? of what can be replaced, of what should not be replaced?_]

544. when amis is travelling, amilun has a dream about his friend attacked by a lion. __a vision__; he trusts it, and suddenly gathers his men. having met amis, the two devise a plan based on __replacement and substitution__ [_translation?_]. an __exchange__: amilun will swear in amis' place. the substitution is perfect; the only exception is that amis does not have sex with his friend's wife; instead he places a naked sword between them [_nude, bare, nonverbal; as far from a verbal sign as it could be_].

	- __sex and friendship__ [_could this be eros and history, and the same regulation of desire found in vergil first and in, for instance, gower later? the forces of history produced or contrasted by eros?_]

640. the plan works on the other side as well; everybody thinks that amilun is amis, and he fights against the seneschal for the ladies' honor. the description of the battle focuses on the gear. the seneschal's armor is resistant; amilun's is not.

770. eventually amilun cuts through the helmet. the narrative spares no bloody details; the blade is covered in flesh and brains.

	- having won the battle, amilun has to marry the count's daughter - and to do so, he has to say his name to the priest. right before this happens, he hears a voice - and only he can hear it - warning him that he will become a leper if he continues. this is the literal __voicing__ of an __ethical doubt__ - when should amilun stop? is he simply absorbing amis' sin, making it a vice that he should expiate through sickness?

	 - the only person who knows about the __substitution__ is the lady; sex is the only thing that can't be replaced.

838. while amis prospers, getting an inheritance and a wife whom he loves, amilun, whose wife does not know about the plot, contracts leprosy. this causes him disgrace - he is abandoned by everyone except for a trusty boy. he is sent away from the castle, in a hut outside the town. __inversion of fortune__, through __substitution__.

922. the sickness and the loneliness experienced by amilun are all described as __falls of his fortune__. the lady eventually imposes that nobody should help him. only the loyal boy remains with him. the two decide to leave the country, forever banished, on a donkey given by the lady.

	- the fall is also a fall from the __original beauty__ [_which was also the perfect physical identity with amis_].

	- during their travels they cross a land where there is an exceptional dearth of food; they sell the donkey for little food.

	- the fall could be generalized to the entire land - or not?

	- there is the idea that the __land__ has decayed from former glory too; it shares his sin [_collective punishment; collective degradation_].

1042. in fact amis' land is instead described as prosperous.

	- as they reach the land, the boy is recognized as a nobleman, and discussed at court. amis decides to help him and his master, although he has not identified them yet. they __share a meal__ : amis sends to the disguised friend half of each course.

	- amilun is eventually discovered through his goblet, of which amis has an identical match (like the two characters; the cup, a work of art [_an object? is this similar to language, or not?_], remained unchanged through time, unlike their bodies, constantly changing).

	- but amis' reaction is the opposite of an __agnition__ [_or it is the most violent - painful - agnition ever written_]; unable to recognize the friend, he kicks and beats him [_thinking that the cup was stolen by him_], then decides to throw him to prison.

	- and here we have a surprising moment. amilun seems to understand the situation only when he __hears his name__. is he blind? or has amilun changed too? he asks amis to kill him; but the boy, owain, stops this.

1144. once the situation has been explained to him, amis curses himself and the __sins__ (his own sins! [_the sins that led to the fall of language, to the tower of babel?_]) that made him blind. he then proceeds to look after his friend as much as he can, involving his wife. eventually a voice in a dream tells him that the only way to have a cure from god is by slaying his children and bathing amilun in their blood. he does. the tragic, bloody fact has a happy ending: the friend is cured, and the children are found alive again. __divine reward__.

	- the tone becomes increasingly __religious__, and the characters pray god more and more [_this happens at the end of horn as well_].

1250. healed, the lord amilun returns to his country, forgives everybody but his wife, who in shame has hidden in her room. the punishment devised for her is specular to the way in which amilun was treated; the hut is turned into a watch-tower, for everybody to see, and she is imprisoned there until her death. "a morters gisent en lombardie"; amilun decides to never remary and grants all of his inheritance to owain, the boy. in mortara their bodies, buried together, grant miracles to the pilgrims (heal blindness and muteness).

- __Form__: __octosyllabic couplets__. the lines often parallel the two friends formally too.
