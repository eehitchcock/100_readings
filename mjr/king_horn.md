#King Horn

##Introduction

- probably the __oldest surviving__ middle english romance - written at the end of s. xiii (1270~?).

- some features of anglo-norman ballads, combined with features of old english verse.

	- combination of several heavy stresses and rhymed couplets.

- among its most striking features, __repetition and symmetry__ stand out.

##Commentary

2. the lines seem to alternate six and seven lines. the genre is immediately introduced as a "song," listened (not heard [_i guess not read_]) by an __imaginary audience__.

12. the king murry and his family; the poem seems almost conscious of its __conventional formularity__ - the queen is "faire ne mighte non ben," the son - horn - "faire ne mighte non beo born." [_repetition._]

	- the poet is initially concerned with __naming__ ("het") appropriately [_probably means "using the right name, the appropriate one"; which is an interesting concern for a translation_].

17. horn is the triumph of this __formular description__ - he has absolutely no match, anywhere [_this is a cardinal element of the original anglo-norman_].

21. here we have twelve "feren" (companions) that, for horn, act like one [_again, same as the original; but perhaps here the tone is more stylized, more caricaturesque; also, horn is immediately extended to the collectivity surrounding him_].
