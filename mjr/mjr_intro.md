While preparing this list I have primarily intended to gain a better understanding of the Middle English canon between the XIII and the XIV century. As a tentative device to delimit, structure, and review this comprehensive though not exhaustive canon, I have organized my list around two of the major generic categories that characterize our perception of the period: on the one hand, the so-called "dream vision," generally characterized by the presence of a dreamer-narrator, and encompassing works of theological contemplation and intellectual debate; on the other, the broad and malleable category of "romance," occasionally identified with any sort of vernacular narrative in verse. The porousness of this classification has allowed me to include several of the most commonly taught texts from the period, embracing both anonymous works (like _Sir Orfeo_, _The York Corpus Christi Cycle_, _Pearl_, _Sir Gawain and the Green Knight_), and  the writings of the first identifiable and renowned authors from the period (Chaucer, Langland, Gower, Hoccleve). Moreover, having to arrange this diverse collection of titles around this apparently limiting dichotomy has prompted me to recognize gaps and continuities in the deployment and

By working on this major list I have primarily intended to gain a better understanding of the Middle English Medieval canon between the XIII and XIV centuries.

The purpose of this major list is twofold. On the one hand, I have intended to compose a selection of texts that might provide me with a comprehensive, though certainly not exhaustive, overview of Middle English literature from the mid 13th century to the beginnings of the 15th century. I have therefore tried to include several canonical authors and their principal works (Chaucer, Langland, Gower, and the Pearl Poet), together with a number of renowned pieces produced by anonymous writers (), that are still generally taught, read, and appreciated as the most representative of the period. On the other hand, my aim has been to trace and interpret the development, within this canon, of two influential formal and thematic strands, which I have tentatively defined as _vision_ and _romance_. These constitute the two interweaving polarities around which I have organized this list. This choice should not be understood as a genre distinction, but instead as an exploration of literary tendencies that incorporate genre (romance, epic, dream and allegorical visions) among several other dynamics, regulating both style and content - partial or complete influence, imitation, translation, tradition, and reaction. This exploratory mode justifies inclusions and divisions that might otherwise seem abrupt or uneven, particularly in the case of the _Pearl_ manuscript or the _Canterbury Tales_, split according to the conjectural filiation of their components (_Sir Gawain and the Green Knight_ and the _Squire's Tale_ for _romance_, _Pearl_ and the _Pardoner's Tale_ for _vision_). The questionability of these demarcations indicates precisely the fundamental literary continuity that I have resolved to investigate. 

It will be noted that, although this list focuses primarily on Middle English literature, I have added a small selection works written in different languages (Latin, insular and continental French, and Italian) and, occasionally, times (12th century and Late Antiquity); the purpose of this inclusion is, again, to trace the development of these two strains - _vision_ and _romance_ - in the context of broad formal and thematic transitions that, as the entirety of medieval culture, transcend and resist linguistic boundaries.
