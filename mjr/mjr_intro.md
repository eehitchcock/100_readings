With this list I have primarily intended to gain a better comprehension of the Middle English canon during the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. As a tentative device to delimit, structure, and review this broad range of texts, in a comprehensive though not exhaustive way, I have organized the collection around two of the major literary categories that usually shape our perception of the period. On the one hand, I have proposed to follow the development of the so-called "dream visions," texts generally characterized by the presence of a dreamer-narrator, and encompassing visionary works of theological contemplation and intellectual debate; on the other, I have tried to define the boundaries of the broad and malleable genre of "romance," a generative repository of narrative tropes and themes, often identifiable  occasionally identified with any sort of vernacular fiction in verse. The porousness of this double classification has allowed me to include several of the most commonly taught texts from the period, embracing both anonymous works (like _Sir Orfeo_, _The York Corpus Christi Cycle_, _Pearl_, _Sir Gawain and the Green Knight_), and the essential writings by the first generations of recognized Middle English authors (Chaucer, Langland, Gower, Hoccleve). Moreover, the decision to arrange this diverse collection of titles around an apparently constraining dichotomy has prompted me to recognize crucial differences and continuities in the deployment and adaptation of a specific set of forms, contents, and motives.
