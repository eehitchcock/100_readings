#Thomas - Tristran

##Introduction

- preserved in nine fragments; complex ms tradition, at least apparently [_it is; the edition has to assemble multiple fragments in a logical or chronological order, and some sections are less understandable than others_].

- the author is known as _thomas von britanje_ thanks to his adaptor _gottfried von strasburg_. his dialect has some _insular features_.

- there are some explicit references to wace's brut [_~1155_]; and the adaptation by gottfried was completed in 1210. we assume that the work was completed around __1180__.

- the author was probably a highly trained clerk; abundant use of rhetorical figures.

##comment

146. the fragments that have been preserved start with the two lovers discovered by the dwarf and the king, and a long, __complex monologue__ by tristram. a unique piece [_even when compared to contemporary works_] - time seems __suspended__ here. the hero occasionally addresses the woman [_who is probably not present_]; but most of his attention is turned towards __doubt__ [_it is a form of monologue that does not do anything; it does not perform a specific function, it simply explores a doubt and a feeling; actual introspection_]. why should he suffer, if he gets nothing in return? we find the motive of changing love - iseult has changed her mind [_at least according to tristran at this point_]. doubt is eventually expressed through an __internal dialogue__ - in his "corage."

235. tristran resolves to love another woman - it will be his way to share her experience ("ho voil partir"). since iseut is in love with two men, tristran will share his love between two women. it is not an act of hatred or resentment; it is only an attempt to __understand__ [_cognitive? experience as an instrument of knowledge?_]. perhaps this marriage and sex ("l'espusaille e l'assembler") will be better than frustrated love; they will make him forget love. __hypothetical mode__ (imaginative?). [_the reflection seems slightly flawed, though; is this speech enough to truly understand how ysolt feels? is this literary form - hypothetical monologue - enough to elaborate empathy for what she is doing? or is experience the necessary step towards the sharing that tristran is actually seeking?_]

357. the monologue is almost doubled in __indirect discourse__; it is followed by a description of tristram's thoughts that culminates in a general __meditation__ on human desire. men change their __definition of good__ whenever the object of their desire changes. there could be, again, a meditation on __language__ here; the vocabulary changes with the changes in our perspective on ethics. the treatment of tristram is unflattering; he is fickle. [_and this is a decision that he takes; it is a decision that then leads to negative consequences, his mistake._]

	- the strong focus on __yseut's name__ might confirm an interest for the ethics of language [_and it is also an instance of substitution; tristran is trying to substitute his beloved one for another woman, just on the basis of a linguistic analogy_].

421. the description of tristran's thoughts becomes extraordinarily __intricate__. the poet is trying to define the reason for his behavior; is he acting thus because of love? the question is addressed through a series of __hypotheses__; it ends with a __generalization__. [_again, it is necessary to remember that this is perhaps the most ruinous choice for the characters involved; expanding on its ethical and affective implications, and trying to make them applicable to the public listening to the story, is a way to convey its centrality._]

641. again an __ethical dilemma__. tristram suddenly remembers his love and his promise to ysolt - by looking at the ring that they had used as a love pawn [_token_]. this memory triggers the __ethical and legal doubt__; having established two love bonds, to whom does he owe satisfaction? the poetical challenge of the anglo-norman [_language and form_] is striking; to convey these subtle, complex __moral questions__ through the simple vividness of __septenary couplets__ [_could also be octosyllabic_]. tristram eventually acknowledges that the doubt is partly caused by __desire__ [_that he actually, sinfully wishes to have sex with the other woman; to have sex in general_].

701. tristram pretends to have a wound that makes him temporarily __impotent__ [_another trope; it is similar to the sword placed between amis and amilun's wife in their story; the genre is also constantly meditating on the many duties of marital love - on what marriage implies_]. the resolution is achieved through a combination of monologue and indirect discourse. desire is eventually __controlled__.

833. a digression through the eyes - the __mental recollections__ - of ysolt, who is worried about tristram and who does not know where he is now. we learn that the last piece of news that she got was about his fight with a giant whose uncle was slain by arthur. the __train of thought__, towards the past, is reproduced here [_that is, the surface of the text becomes the woman's memory, and her memory becomes the truth that the text documents now_].

	- tristram's companions do not share the rest of what they know, because of envy.

941. we learn that ysolt is a poet, and a singer. she composes and performs __lais__ about love and tragedy [_like the irish women in the romance de horn_]. we also discover that she has a wooer whom she refuses strongly, managin to repel his threat completely. the female side seems stronger [_morally stronger; this is in opposition to what we see happening in the roman de horn, where every woman becomes mad for the main character_]. the wooer, cariado, tells her that tristran might have found a new lover for himself.

1092. we find tristram jealous, as he interacts with __a statue__ - "un image" - made by him to remember ysolt. tristram uses the image to __perform__ his love and anxiety. like ysolt's lays, the statue seems a double of the romance and its function ; a way to explore __hypothetical scenarios__, to meditate upon ethical doubts. the poet then describes the frustration experienced by the four characters of the plot - each lacking her [_or his_] object.

	- the unanswerable question is - who suffers the most among them? each seems a __double__ of the other; it seems a system of permutations of fulfillment and lack - exactness [_a perfect square, where the combinations are established mathematically; the theme of duplicity, found in marie de france as well, is here explored systematically_].

1197. as tristran, his wife and his ally ride towards a foreign land, the lady reveals that the knight has not had sex with her through an elaborate occurrence; as her horse steps into a puddle, some water splashes onto her thigh and she confesses - that is more than she has even gotten. a small, trivial detail [_this is another recurrent feature in marie de france_]. laughter.

	- again, we lack a name for verisimilitude here - for what we would call realism [_remember that according to prof. johnson this could be a mnemonic device - to add memorable details, details that make us feel as if we had actually experienced these spaces and these happenings_].

1264. tristran and his ally, kamerdin, run into the king's court; it is a huge and festive group. the two men start looking for ysolt; we do too, through their eyes [_this romance uses the point of view attentively_].

1399. the poet reports in __direct speech__ the angry words spoken by brengain against tristran, his brother-in-law (_it is_ his b.i.l.) and ysolt herself. the speech is well articulated and almost persuasive; the poet is incorporating __a different perspective__ on his story within his poem [_polyphony; introspection?_]. tristram wants to take the maid with him, because kamerdin (his buddy knight) is in love with her. they are treating the woman as a piece of property. now ysolt is angry at tristram.

	- the romance seems, in part, a description of the __mutability of desires__.

	- ysolt insists on the fact that she now is in a __foreign land__. another __core theme__.

1576. in an escalation of hostility, the lady - brengain - delivers a harsh acccusation against ysolt and her lechery. the woman is accused of having been spoiled by her vicious sin. the tone is exaggerated and violent, but it may be __true__ [_the poem is very aware of its moral complexity; therefore it tries to include different voices and perspectives on the events that it is depicting_].

	- this is authentic __polyphony__, the embedding of a narrative and its ideological contrary. the event - __adultery__ - is first briefly described, then __interpreted__ in every perspective [_and yes, another way to read this is to think about interpretation; to compare the relationship between event and meditation on the event with the constant interpretive moves practiced by visionary writers such as hoccleve or julian; it also has the same value of temporal expansion_].

1673. both women consider the adulterous relationship shameful; brengain threatens ysolt to reveal her secret, but then simply warns the king against her, while assuring him that nothing has happened. it is an __ambiguous strategy__. the poem is decidedly dark.

1769. we find a mention of __england__ in this section; this is where mark [_the king_] and ysolt [_his wife_] live, and where tristram has found her. brengain is actually helping the two lovers [_but that is not her purpose_], by addressing the king's suspicions towards the other wooer, cariado. she is believed.

	- her plan might have been conceived to have control over ysolt's interactions. unsure [_this eventually seems the case; but the situation might be slightly more complex_].

1883. everybody is unhappy - this seems to be the __persistent consequence__ of every attempt to be happy [_to change one's condition_]. we find here the motive of the __disguised knight__, returning to his court as a leper [_think about amilun as an actual leper at the end of his poem_]. he is identified by the queen ysolt; but they are discovered by brengain, who sends him away. tristran hides in the palace; the two lovers hate their own love and desire; it is __sorrow__.

	- the tale is constantly __moralizing__ against itself, almost stopping itself for its __immorality__.

2005. tristram eventually convinces brengain to side with him and ysolt again. she does (the decisive piece of information concerns her own lover). the two main characters finally meet and rejoice (have sex). then tristram goes back to "ysolt de bretaingne," who is upset about his love for "l'altre ysolt." we find here the motive, familiar to mdf, of __doubles__ - __between the continent and the island__.

2103. a description of the sorrow and devotion endured by ysolt; to please her the two heroes - tristran and kamerdin - visit england again, dressed as penitents. this journey is described very briefly; it culminates in the murder of cariado, during a joust.

2153. at this point thomas introduces a __philological problem__; he has to choose among __many versions__ of the same narrative. they are often in contrast with each other. he follows the version told by breri, an authority in the "gestes e lé cuntes" of "bretaingne." the digression serves especially to confute the episode about the dwarf. thomas, who explicitly identifies himself as the composer, proves that this version is not __true__ [_ethical responsibility, like the one felt towards the problematic topic explored by the narrative; to confute the discarded version, thomas uses everyday logic - the version that he discards is less likely, and therefore not true_].

2285. we find here a new double; thomas tells his version of the story, and here we read of tristran the lover meeting __tristran the dwarf__ ("le naim"), who seeks help to rescue his wife.

	- this one lives somewhere around brittany; the two are linked by __similar feelings__ [_that is, tristran the dwarf uses empathy to obtain the assistance of tristran the lover_].

2433. the mission is a disaster; one tristram dies, the other is wounded with poison. is this the ending that could await tristram the lover, if he followed his desire? [_moralizing hypothesis?_] wounded, tristram begs kamerdin to go fetch ysolt for him; the version differs only slightly.

2591. the potion of love drunk by the couple is referred to as "la nostre mort" in tristram's recollection (but that has apparently nothing to do with the causes of his current suffering - or has it? [_again, the episode could be read as a doubling of the main narrative; the same device seen in amis e amilun, with the transference of sin to the innocent friend_]). convinced by his friend, kamerdin sails to england.

2755. the plan is discovered by ysolt the virhin, who secretly plots her revenge. but nevertheless kamerdin is able to reach __london__ - "le recovrer d'engleterre" [_the centre of england_]. the poet describes its thriving marketplace with vividness, praising its energy and cosmopolitanism. kamerdin is there under the disguise of a __merchant__. with his rich products, the knight approaches the queen. thanks to his precious wares, they communicate.

2963. the women flee on the thames. the __sea__ becomes a predominant image in this final section. the sea is the space of tristram's expectations - of home, desire. as they are approaching the shores of brittany, the women are held back by a tempest. __paralisis__. we have a monologue by ysolt, where she predicts the death of both. it is a long and sorrowful __imagination__ (__hypothetical mode__ [_but one could also call it imaginative_]) about death.

3067. the tempest ends; but, as the ship stops again, even closer to its destination, ysolt the virgin tricks her husband and makes him believe that its sails are black. having lost every hope, tristran dies. ysolt, on the land, sees the signs of mourning and finds out about the death of her lover. tragic ending.

3143. after a final monologue, this time a fantasy of love and life and joy, ysolt dies as well, while holding the body of the dead knight. in the final lines, thomas, again introducing himself as the poet, warns the readers against "tuiz engins d'amur."

	- the work, however, is especially __dedicated to lovers__. undoubtable __moral ambiguity__.

##New fragment (the cumbria, translated by judith shoaf)

- the small fragment of dialogue is based on a __verbal ambiguity__ - a pun - between _la mer_ (the sea) and _l'amer_ (the love). ysolt complains about the bitterness of this entity, which first served as a background to their love, and eventually became the place of their tragic death (unpredictable nature).
