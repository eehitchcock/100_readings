- __Topics__: speech (less than in the a. n.; the saracens here don't need translators; king horn's own body speaks for itself); religion and wonder (emphasized from the more secular, historical a-n); _horn has one more rib here_ - a memorable detail, both non-linguistic, or non-verbal, and religiously charged.

##Introduction

- probably the __oldest surviving__ middle english romance - written at the end of s. xiii (1270~?).

- some features of anglo-norman ballads, combined with features of old english verse.

	- combination of several heavy stresses and rhymed couplets.

- among its most striking features, __repetition and symmetry__ stand out.

##Commentary

2. the lines seem to alternate six and seven lines. the genre is immediately introduced as a "song," listened (not heard [_i guess not read_]) by an __imaginary audience__.

12. the king murry and his family; the poem seems almost conscious of its __conventional formularity__ - the queen is "faire ne mighte non ben," the son - horn - "faire ne mighte non beo born." [_repetition._]

	- the poet is initially concerned with __naming__ ("het") appropriately [_probably means "using the right name, the appropriate one"; which is an interesting concern for a translation_].

17. horn is the triumph of this __formular description__ - he has absolutely no match, anywhere [_this is a cardinal element of the original anglo-norman_].

21. here we have twelve "feren" (companions) that, for horn, act like one [_again, same as the original; but perhaps here the tone is more stylized, more caricaturesque; also, horn is immediately extended to the collectivity surrounding him_].

44. here we find the __foreign element__ - the "shipes fiftene | with sarazins kene," unexpected __invaders__ transforming the king's summer "pleing" - turing it into tragedy.

47. the first __direct discourse__ belongs to an anonymous saracen - and it is a __declaration of war__ - they shall "slon" (slay) "alle that crist liveth upon."

62. the king's demise is justified by __numeric inferiority__ - the enemy was unfair [_this element was probably absent in the original a. n. text; there we did not have a description of the initial attack in suddene, and the battles seemed more balanced - less biased in their treatment of the enemy; in fact, trickery was most often imputable to horn and his side_].

63. the invasion reaches the interior of the land; it is characterized by religious hatred.

	- the saracens speak __english perfectly__ (apparently): their difference is religious [_therefore, we might say that the anglo-norman had a stronger sense of linguistic difference; farther from the clash produced by the conquest, this text seems less aware of some cultural differences that might have been applicable to the anglo-norman invasion; here language has become almost unperceivable, and the biggest difference is, as we have said, cultural_].

84. we briefly follow godhild (murri's wife) as she mourns the husband and then hides "under a roche of stone." here, hidden in exile, she serves god and prays for her son [_this narrative element was described only in the conclusive section of the anglo-norman romance, in a flashback; here it is introduced immediately; it seems to contribute to the religious and marvelous overtones of the new version_].

88. as it describes the hero's captivity, the song insists on his __divine__ beauty - given to him by christ [_again, horn's beauty was instrumental to providence, but it was not an inherently divine quality; this middle english version seems to emphasize the religious and the miraculous elements of the genre; remember that later authors, like chaucer, hoccleve, and gawain, will exploit precisely this feature_]. horn bears the sign of his __religious ascendancy__ on the exterior [_as a visible, readable sign_].

91. but his beauty (fairnesse) serves him; it is what stops the pagan from killing or flaying him [_compassion; this element was in the anglo norman too, although perhaps not as emphasized as here_].

114. the __second direct speech__ belongs to an arab "admirad" (emir) - "of wordes he was bald." the speech is still in perfect english. the christian hero signifies through his __silent looks__ - a dumb sign [_like christ in the ecce homo of the york cycle_]; words belong to the __foreign world__ [_this element seemed completely absent from the anglo norman, where the author was instead very attentive to the presence of translators and mediators to introduce the presence of the african invaders_]. the emir suggests that horn should be drowned in a ship, together with his fellows [therefore, this is not pity, but only a different kind of punishment].

124. the text insists on the fact that horn is only a child; hence his __impotence__.

131. here horn __finally speaks__; the description of his journey resembles flood in genesis [_again a religious element_].

	- indeed, the signs are those of __natural world restored__ - "foyles singe [...] gras springe."

143. the ship is sent to __sudene__, the child's mysterious homeland, as an obscure __nonverbal sign__ [_prof. crane was right; the difference between the two texts consists precisely in the verbosity of the anglo-norman characters when compared to their middle english counterparts; agnition is a nonverbal event in the middle english, whereas in the anglo-norman it has to occur through the aboundant and elaborate language of its hero_], containing - __meaning__ - the entirety of king's horn verbal speech.

161. here we find a __new geographic alterity__ - a "westernesse" ruled by a different king - "almair king" [this was _brittany_ in the anglo-norman]. the space is __exotic__, but the culture is familiar - __christian__ [this similarity was not emphasized in the original version; again, _emphasis on the christian - religious overtones_].

164. the new king speaks "wordes that were mild" - there is a strong focus on __speech__ and its quality in this romance - __the ways in which things mean__ [so, which one focused more on language? i guess that, as a working hypothesis, we might say that the middle english explores linguistic alterity in a more suprising way; the anglo-norman was more literal in its treatment].

167. "alle throttene" - we get a confirmation of the fact that horn is with his fellows.

199. horn's description of the invasion and their journey is violent and pitiful [words are an instrument of empathy].

222. the interaction between the child and the foreign king is slow, and described carefully [probably similar to the anglo-norman].

244. the foreigner devises a modest education for horn; that of a stweard and a minstrel [_here we find an interesting difference; horn, although an orphan, was recognized as the son of a nobleman in the original, and educated as such_].

264. a female character - rymenhild; she immediately falls in love with "horn child" (who is, however, still very much a child) - so much that she "negh heo gan wexe wild" - went almost mad [same as the anglo-norman; only, there we had her maids driven mad by his looks; here she is the one for whom the author uses this strong phrasing]. the symptom is __silence__ - realistically happening anywhere - "at borde | in the halle."

	- her shyness is moving - "of folk heo hadde drede." not speaking is a silent woe [silence is perhaps the strongest difference between the anglo-norman and middle english].

267. and indeed - "in heorte heo hadde wo" - silence heightens her grief.

275. the girl decides to send him a "sonde" - a __written message__ (in __indirect discourse__) [_great difference from the anglo-norman; there everything was achieved through the mediation of messengers; this detail implies that both characters are literate_].

283. a small, significant detail - horn is now "the yonge," no longer "child" [_this difference was perhaps perceivable in the anglo-norman, but probably not this explicitly_].

288. the steward decides to play a trick on the girl - sending her athulf instead of horn [same as the a. n.].

300. __repetition__ is indeed a crucial rhetorical device - rymenhild again "gan wexe wild."

319. the __substitute__ confesses [athulf reveals what has happened] - and we learn that horn has __one more rib__ [_an invention in the middle english; a very interesting addition - is it a marvelous or religious detail? or are there any latent implications?_ like women and __adam__].

336. the whole misunderstanding mixes __verbal and nonverbal__ (physical appearance) signs in an unexpected, counterintuitive way. rymenhilde understands that the man is not horn only when he says so - and yet, she blames him for being "so unorn" (ugly) [remember that she had not seen him in the a. n.].

	- "with muchel mesaventur | schame mote thu fonge" [this is probably the curse that rymenhild addresses to athulf] - terms that seem drawn from an __anti-romance__ [the opposite of misadventure].

352. athelbrus control over horn is justified by __diplomatic reasons__ - as a way to please the king [this passage deserves some further attention; it is, again, something that was not in the a. n., at least apparently].

380. words uttered and words __concealed__ are definitely a big motive here; horn is now a true steward.

390. a reversal of the convention: it is horn's beauty that "at the bur gan lighte" - lightens the room [_the convention is that of chaucer and - if we remember correctly - alain de lille; it is the heavenly woman, or the personified allegory of nature or some other deity - who brightens the room; another english addition_].

416. more emphasis on __worde that matter__: "horn tho him bithoghte | what he speke mighte" [that is, we might infer, thorn placed a lot of attention on the words that he was going to utter].

446. horn's plan is a __social rise__ in a __foreign land__. his scruples are __diplomatic__ as well.

502. "sume hi were withere" (evil): __prolexis__ - we learn about the evil intentions of some of the twelve.

534. there is truly a persistent emphasis on thought and speech - __silent and voiced meditation__ [this could be simply an inherited trait from the a. n. tradition].

552. even as a knight, horn is simply too young - __immature__ [this was implied, perhaps, but not explicit in the a. n.], "of o dai al isprunge."

570. a __written sign__, used as a token of love - a ring "igrave 'rymenhild the yonge'."

598. a striking moment of __meaningful intimacy__ among the knight (horn) and his horse. silent speech [no memory of this in the a. n.].

616. horn reverts the circumstances of his demise - he finds another ship full of arabs - but this time he kills them all. no words, just __violence__ (they are called "hethene honde"); notice that, however, he has __indirect speech__ - __direct speech__ is for the stranger [again; apart from this detail, circumstance follows the a. n.].

638. the ship was "al with sarazins kyn | and more londisse men." interestingly __vague__ adjective.

651. here enters a new character, a sort of __anti-horn__: "fikenhild | the wurste moder child."

654. "aventure" is here something that people _seek_ (sen): is this different from anglo-norman? [_no; there too horn was very eager to live his adventures; but the vocabulary might be different there._]

	- this aventure, besides, is sought in the bed chambers; horn has matured.

656. rymenhild normal state is to look "of witte" - mad. she dreamt of an uncatchable fish [the dream in the a. n. was dreamt by one of her maids, and it was a dream of success and pregnancy, involving a bird].

	- horn immediately asks her to "turne thine swevene" - interpret her dream.

690. we already find a juxtaposition of the king and the knight in bed (like _sggk_).

718. __exile__. horn is banished from this country as well; quietly he obeys [he was not quiet at all in the original; the reasons seem those of a diplomatic mistake, not a betrayal motivated by envy].

758. a new ship; this time horn deliberately embarks on it - he leaves towards his land.

	- the destination, we soon discover, is actually __hirelonde__ [so it is true! then maybe the "westernesse" actually referred to brittany too] (two inhabitants: harild and durild).

773. horn adopts a __false name__: "cutbert." with the new land spontaneously come __new identity__.

784. everybody feels __attraction__ for horn - "ne sagh i nevre my lyve | so fair knyght aryve" [the language of desire was a constant of the previous version too].

	- his beauty - a __readable sign__ for every man - is proof of his worth even abroad [_the connection between these ideas and those of vision is the same; interpretation and the many layers of reality that separate us from true meaning; the gluttony of the material world, the gluttony for the words that we use to describe it, slowly separating us from its true understanding_].

	- in fact, names change, but the __essence__ stays the same. "for he is the faireste man." [_isn't this, then, in a way, the anti-amis-e-amilun?_]

809. "a geant" enters the foreign king's castle - suddenly, unexpectedly. strange threat. the giant speaks as an ambassador (it is christmas) for the invaders on the country's shores [there is nothing here about horn living in peace and proving his worth with another woman; the fabulous element is emphasized].

	- a game of three to one is established a s way of determining the ruler there.

898. __numerical superiority__ is rejected by horn [a simpler way to handle the battle scenes; a more abstract one]. notice how the muslims are still called "hunde."

847. notice how the poem alternates between the hero's __two names__ - cutberd and horn.

882. two elements trigger the full force of horn's violence - the __memory__ of his lost family and the love token from rymenhilde. __self "agnition"__, in a way.

912. horn inherits the __kingdom of ireland__ (since the two sons are dead [same as a. n.]). more social rise.

925. we now shift to rymenhilde, since the seven years of their agreement have passed.

947. the fortuitous meeting always happens in the woods - the place where __chance__ overcomes __intention__ [_the place of fatum and aventure_].

956. rymenhilde is always accompanied by the __same rhyme__ - "that for him gan wexe wild" [this is what horn does; this is the effect of his supernatural beauty, that we always register in the female counterpart].

990. the __misaventure__ (happening to the characters, who receive it passively): the messenger dies [probably a messenger sent from brittany to ireland; let us remember that time is passing for both characters].

1022. a new expedition - this time "right in to westernesse." horn makes his aventure.

1076. a pilgrim reports the news of the sad wedding; horn exchanges clothes and appearance with him - a new __disguised identity__. but this time the signs are __non-verbal__ (not just a name) [the content is the same as the a. n., but this emphasis on signifiers was missing there].

1088. a sudden explosion of brutal __violence__ - horn throws the gate's guardian over the bridge.

	- the man was supposedly innocent; in debasing his looks, horn debased his ethical code [a detail that we don't remember in the a. n.].

1101. from "beggeres rowe," where horn looks for his wife, we move to the perspective of athulf.

	- this passage alternates the __two standpoints__ - from horn to his fellow to horn again.

1155. the interaction between rymenhild and horn employs the tropes (allegorical?) found in the __dream__ as a __secret code__ for the two lovers. __vision has become language__ [_this passage could be the key to the whole translation; the agnition was very elaborate in a. n., and its final stage was the simile of the 'goshawk' - but there the dream had not been shared between the two lovers_].

1160. however, rymenhilde does not recognize the __signs__ - because horn is __not readable__.

1169. the whole section plays with the __homonymy__ between horn (character) and "horn" (vessel) [same as the a. n.].

	- "horn dronk of horn a stunde." names are __unreliable__, perhaps; things (essences) matter more [this is the content of the a. n. _amis e amilun_; but was it the case for the a. n. _horn_?].

1215. the ring is also __insufficient for the agnition__; the sign of horn is horn himself (his fairnesse [_this is the christ interpreted of the york cycle; interpreted until the very last_]): "he wipede that blake of his swere." wiped away the black.

	- that had been the final detail of his disguise as a pilgrim - a black neck.

1275. another recurrent formula: "liste | a tale mid the beste." it's as if the romance was made of a string of __chained stories__ - as if it was a performance of __stories within stories__.

	- the echoes with the conclusion of the odyssey are especially strong; no chances?

	- isn't there any way to track the history of this source - from greece to here?

1301. and __another expedition__ - always reverting wrongs from the past - back to suddene.

	- notice how horn explains his exile as the outcome of __calumny__ spoken against him.

1316. another __nonverbal sign__: the cross placed on a knight's shield - proof of his faith [this is the moment when horn arrives on the shore of his land and listens to the story of its invasion; a new detail, not present in the original if i remember correctly].

1377. here we have a dense passage: "horn sede on his nime, | 'iblessed beo the time | i com to suddene | with mine irisse menne: | we sulle the hundes teche | to speken ure speche." the __stranger__ teaches his speech to his own homeland; inhabited by "hundes." [_inversion that deserves further attention._]

1400. the __restoration__ is collective: horn rescues his mother, and he builds "chapeles and chirche."

1424. another __dream__: the queen is threatened by fikenhild; the villain built a castle to rape [probably just kidnap] her.

1481. horn's final __disguise__: as a minstrel; is this a synthesis of __appearance and voice__ (speech)?

1491. horn sings a lay - "he makede rymenhilde lay." this works as __another sign__; notice, as well, that before acting horn looks, again, at the __engraved ring__ [this ending uses passages that were elsewhere in the original; horn sung in ireland while being seduced by a different woman; here the two have been conflated _though she's there_].

1507. here we find a wide conclusion - horn sails to every kingdom which he has visited, and for each he appoints a king - favoring both the land and his own men [different from the original, again]. this ending achieves a full sense of __circularity and satisfaction__.

1537. and now the poet remind us that, in the present, they are both __dead__. a weird, unexpected turn [is he referring to the culture that produced the original that he had been translating as well?]. perhaps a way of distancing the romance's __temporality__ from our own?

1545. the conclusion of the poem is a blessing for the audience gathered listening.
