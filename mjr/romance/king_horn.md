#King Horn

##Introduction

- probably the __oldest surviving__ middle english romance - written at the end of s. xiii (1270~?).

- some features of anglo-norman ballads, combined with features of old english verse.

	- combination of several heavy stresses and rhymed couplets.

- among its most striking features, __repetition and symmetry__ stand out.

##Commentary

2. the lines seem to alternate six and seven lines. the genre is immediately introduced as a "song," listened (not heard [_i guess not read_]) by an __imaginary audience__.

12. the king murry and his family; the poem seems almost conscious of its __conventional formularity__ - the queen is "faire ne mighte non ben," the son - horn - "faire ne mighte non beo born." [_repetition._]

	- the poet is initially concerned with __naming__ ("het") appropriately [_probably means "using the right name, the appropriate one"; which is an interesting concern for a translation_].

17. horn is the triumph of this __formular description__ - he has absolutely no match, anywhere [_this is a cardinal element of the original anglo-norman_].

21. here we have twelve "feren" (companions) that, for horn, act like one [_again, same as the original; but perhaps here the tone is more stylized, more caricaturesque; also, horn is immediately extended to the collectivity surrounding him_].

44. here we find the __foreign element__ - the "shipes fiftene | with sarazins kene," unexpected __invaders__ transforming the king's summer "pleing" - turing it into tragedy.

47. the first __direct discourse__ belongs to an anonymous saracen - and it is a __declaration of war__ - they shall "slon" (slay) "alle that crist liveth upon."

62. the king's demise is justified by __numeric inferiority__ - the enemy was unfair [_this element was probably absent in the original a. n. text; there we did not have a description of the initial attack in suddene, and the battles seemed more balanced - less biased in their treatment of the enemy; in fact, trickery was most often imputable to horn and his side_].

63. the invasion reaches the interior of the land; it is characterized by religious hatred.

	- the saracens speak __english perfectly__ (apparently): their difference is religious [_therefore, we might say that the anglo-norman had a stronger sense of linguistic difference; farther from the clash produced by the conquest, this text seems less aware of some cultural differences that might have been applicable to the anglo-norman invasion; here language has become almost unperceivable, and the biggest difference is, as we have said, cultural_].

84. we briefly follow godhild (murri's wife) as she mourns the husband and then hides "under a roche of stone." here, hidden in exile, she serves god and prays for her son [_this narrative element was described only in the conclusive section of the anglo-norman romance, in a flashback; here it is introduced immediately; it seems to contribute to the religious and marvelous overtones of the new version_].

88. as it describes the hero's captivity, the song insists on his __divine__ beauty - given to him by christ [_again, horn's beauty was instrumental to providence, but it was not an inherently divine quality; this middle english version seems to emphasize the religious and the miraculous elements of the genre; remember that later authors, like chaucer, hoccleve, and gawain, will exploit precisely this feature_]. horn bears the sign of his __religious ascendancy__ on the exterior [_as a visible, readable sign_].

91. but his beauty (fairnesse) serves him; it is what stops the pagan from killing or flaying him [_compassion; this element was in the anglo norman too, although perhaps not as emphasized as here_].

114. the __second direct speech__ belongs to an arab "admirad" (emir) - "of wordes he was bald." the speech is still in perfect english. the christian hero signifies through his __silent looks__ - a dumb sign [_like christ in the ecce homo of the york cycle_]; words belong to the __foreign world__ [_this element seemed completely absent from the anglo norman, where the author was instead very attentive to the presence of translators and mediators to introduce the presence of the african invaders_]. the emir suggests that horn should be drowned in a ship, together with his fellows [therefore, this is not pity, but only a different kind of punishment].

124. the text insists on the fact that horn is only a child; hence his __impotence__.

131. here horn __finally speaks__; the description of his journey resembles flood in genesis [_again a religious element_].

	- indeed, the signs are those of __natural world restored__ - "foyles singe [...] gras springe."

143. the ship is sent to __sudene__, the child's mysterious homeland, as an obscure __nonverbal sign__ [_prof. crane was right; the difference between the two texts consists precisely in the verbosity of the anglo-norman characters when compared to their middle english counterparts; agnition is a nonverbal event in the middle english, whereas in the anglo-norman it has to occur through the aboundant and elaborate language of its hero_], containing - __meaning__ - the entirety of king's horn verbal speech.

161. here we find a __new geographic alterity__ - a "westernesse" ruled by a different king - "almair king" [this was _brittany_ in the anglo-norman]. the space is __exotic__, but the culture is familiar - __christian__ [this similarity was not emphasized in the original version; again, _emphasis on the christian - religious overtones_].

164. the new king speaks "wordes that were mild" - there is a strong focus on __speech__ and its quality in this romance - __the ways in which things mean__ [so, which one focused more on language? i guess that, as a working hypothesis, we might say that the middle english explores linguistic alterity in a more suprising way; the anglo-norman was more literal in its treatment].

167. "alle throttene" - we get a confirmation of the fact that horn is with his fellows.

199. horn's description of the invasion and their journey is violent and pitiful [words are an instrument of empathy].

222. the interaction between the child and the foreign king is slow, and described carefully [probably similar to the anglo-norman].

244. the foreigner devises a modest education for horn; that of a stweard and a minstrel [_here we find an interesting difference; horn, although an orphan, was recognized as the son of a nobleman in the original, and educated as such_].

264. a female character - rymenhild; she immediately falls in love with "horn child" (who is, however, still very much a child) - so much that she "negh heo gan wexe wild" - went almost mad [same as the anglo-norman; only, there we had her maids driven mad by his looks; here it
