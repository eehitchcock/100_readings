#Troilus and Criseyde

##Introduction

- the work could be cosidered a loose translation of boccaccio's filostrato, composed in the mid 1380s; it probably started __simply as a translation__, later revised heavily.

- among the characteristics of chaucer's translation, when compared to the italian original, we should count an "added vehemence" - __intensification__ [is this a sort of _linguistic gluttony_?]; an occasional increase in __precision__, especially when the poet is describing the main characters' interior world - the concealed functioning of their feelings. there are some __new motifs__ as well, like troilus' passiveness.

- we also count many additional sources for details and __interpolations__ - the trojan books, boethius, dante, ovid, the roman de la rose.

- chaucer was already an accomplished poet when he began working on the tc.

- boccaccio's filostrato was written around 1335.

- there is a whole school of criticism according to which tc should be considered __drama__ [because of detailed character and voice, probably].

- the poet's concern seems to be to show __how__ we make ethical choices.

- his focus is on __dilemma__ [ethical doubt]; his explicit themes, however, are __fortune__ and __love__.

##Comment

###Book 1

56. the poet seeks the assistance of both the furies and his reader; he wants them to feel __empathy__ for his protagonist. he aligns himself with troilus as an unsatisfied lover; the three elements should be united by __compassion__: writer, character, reader.

133. the poet presupposes a knowledge of the __trojan matter__; he then describes calkas' prediction of the __destruction of the city__ [historical depth; historical awareness - calkas is like the reader, aware of the finiteness of pagan history]; he leaves a daughter of "aungelik" beauty behind, who bids hector for pity and protection. she deserves __compassion__ as well [everybody is seeking compassion at this stage], although the author cannot say whether she had children or not; he is a reader too.

259. __fortune__ governs the events of __war and history__, but the poet will not focus on the destruction of the city; instead, he describes the "olde usage" of its inhabitants, who have a feast to celebrate the palladion. here we find both the beautiful criseyde, humbly dressed as a widow, and troilus, who isl looking at the women and at their admirers, and who scorns love as a dangerous folly. but, all of a sudden, love pierces his heart. many __metaphors and explanations__ are used to describe this transition [which is a glance, an instance, expanded through the poetical power of analogy, infinitely protracted]; chaucer final remark is that one should try to __follow__ what love imposes [here we find the customary analogy between love and fortune in the post-boethian tradition].

356. the __phenomenology__ of the act; the slow look that reaches criseyda, and a description of her attitude. after the happening, troilus __conceals__ his feelings; he keeps joking with lovers about their __unfortunate destiny__, bound to someone else's will [the beginning of performance; every layer of troilus' behavior, from now on, will be a form of performance].

434. troilus is uncapable of __pretending more__; he remains in bed, to think about the ways in which he should __experience and perform__ his feelings - the method is "imagenynge"; so much of this section is __introspection__ and __hypothetical mode__; he eventually decides to love [conscious deliberation], and celebrates this with a __canticus__, translated from petrarch. __private performance__.

	- the poem uses __oxymoron__ as the definition of love's effects; it is followed by his __submission to love__.

546. after the __mediation__ of __poetical discourse__, and his explicit submission, the symptoms are intensified - he can't think about anything else; at the same time, he becomes an exceptional warrior, driven by the wish to be known by her [the motif of courtly love as a cause for ethical improvement]. to justify his symptoms, he uses a __lie__ about a "fever" [anticipating the later performance of sickness; the approach to this motif, traditionally boethian, is suspended between performance and reality - between deliberate and inevitable]; the beloved woman, however, does not seem to care [or notice] (or mabye she __pretends__ - the poet cannot tell) [so many elements of the story are _perceived_ in the third person singular; chaucer is probably trying to expose how our knowledge of sources is an indirect learning, a form of judging from appearances, from outward performance].

	- more __hypothetical mode__: troilus imagines that the woman has _another lover_. he complains in solitude; sincerely.

658. pandarus visits him, unexpectedly. he starts by interrogating his friend about the __cause__ of his affliction. troilus confesses that it is __love__; pandarus insists that, although he's been unfortunate in love, he can help him; he reminds troilus of paris' lover grieving letter [a letter written by the woman who paris was in love with before meeting helen; again, we have references to a __literary tradition__; the __culture of love__ is superior to its __experience__].

770. pandarus' speech uses __many rhetorical tricks__ to gain troilus' trust; he speaks by employing __vague maxims__; he uses pieces of __authority__ to strengthen his argument; however, troilus only responds to his abrupt and loud cry of "awake!"; he is a __parody__ of a boethian figure; he is trying to __impersonate personification__ [_interpretation of personifcation_ - like chaucer], and he is drawing on a well established __literary tradition__ [like lady bertilak in _sggk_, during the bedroom meetings with gawain], but only the __genuine imperative__ [awake; straightforward speech act] works.

868. pandarus introduces __death__ - and __time__ - into the argument [although troilus had been threatening to die many times]; he now employs a more __practical__ perspective - what is the purpose of __suffering__, if we will die? troilus is conviced - death would be useless in his __performance__; he needs to be __strategic__ [the word is very relevant here; criseyde is troy]. pandarus uses some _boethius_ to contrast troilus' despair about fortune's wheel - it spins; he promises a __remedy__.

973. pandarus has a __physical way__ of approaching his interlocutor - he "shakes" him; and thus he gets a __confession__ about the _name_ (actions are more effective than _words_). he compliments troilus for the choice; then, laughing, reminds him of how he used to make fun of lovers and their performances [key element: troilus was well __aware of their lies__]. it is the time to __repent__ for troilus [a religious repentance in front of the god of love]; after that, pandarus recommends a __strategy of virtuous dissimulation__ [this is reminiscent of similar concepts of performance and adherence to a literary tradition found in _roman de la rose_].

1092. pandarus reveals that the woman is his niece; he promises that everyone will profit from his __mediation__; troilus thanks him profusely, almost __reverentially__. pandarus departs, having promised his "trowthe"; trolus, comforted but not healed, displays virtuous chivalry.

###Book 2

49. the incipit is __apologetic__; the author announces that the second book will be about __hope__; then he asks to be forgiven for what seems incongruous with the present custom or sensibility, because his is simply __translating__ a story from __antiquity__ (latyn), not using his own experience; and, as we know, customs in love change as quickly as the language that we speak. __history__.

154. the chirping of prognes wakes up pandarus, whom we not follow. he surprises criseyde in the orchard, while she is reading the _roman de th√®bes_ with some friends. pandarus' behavior is invasive and insistent. he tempts criseyda, and pricks her curiosity, by __concealing__ the purpiose of his visit.

252. pandarus uses a comparison with hector, in the context of war, to introduce the topic of war [that is, the topic of troilus as a good warrior]; criseyda has, in fact, heard stories about his __bravery__ on the field. he insists on her need to "__daunce__." they are close; there is __complicity__ between them; it is the __contrast of allegiances__ found elsewhere - who do i owe my loyalty to? pandarus decides to privilege his male friend against his niece. homosocial bounds are, for now, stronger than the principles of heterosexual affection.

385. pandarus strategically prepares his delivery of the news about troilus; he wants to attain an effect on the listener. [__mediation__ and levels of __mediation__; levels of __paraphrasis__; __translation__ as the __interpretation__ of a __foreign object__; same degree of __complexity__ between __signifier and signified__; how could we not compare this to the __angels__ reading the foreign language of god's wisdom in the ninth sphere?] as he tells her the name of the lover, he introduces __violence__ and __tragedy__ - he weeps and threatens to kill himself. the actual threat is followed by an ethical threat, questioning criseyde's virtue; eventually pandarus changes the purpose of his speech - troilus' intentions are pure, he won't "to temple go, that he th'images eteth" (373). who is the image?

490. criseyde feels betrayed by her uncle, who should protect her from love; she feels as if she could die; however, threatened again by pandarus, and fearing for her __social respectability__1, she agrees to indulge troilus' desire; but she won't go further. __contract__.

588. asked about the way in which he has discovered the nature of troilus' love, pandarus invents a story that seems to betray a good knowledge of __romance conventions__; he creates a false monologue of love that troilus would have uttered in an orchard, while he was spying on him; this is followed by the __chamber scene__ that we have witnessed. __traditore__ [pandarus acting at a _traditore_ at every level].

686. left by herself, criseyde starts meditating about the __words__ uttered by her uncle; her thoughts are interrupted by the clamor announcing the arrival of troilus from the battlefield, who she admires through her window; it is a __display__ of warrior and sexual prowess. as she starts __considering his qualities__, and his love for her, she __falls in love__. it is a "sodeyn love," but it began here ["sodeyn" but somewhat deliberate; "sodeyn" but not entirely irrational or instictual].

812. the poet describes criseyde's thoughts about love; her positive reaction to troilus' attention, then the negative __implications__, both individual and social; it is a __long interior monolgue__. thoughts hit her as an __exterior force__, which she has to slowly __unfold__ afterwards [complex phenomenology]; in the conclusion, divided between the two perspectives, she becomes a __living oxymoron__ - hoot / cold.

903. the final stage of criseyde's "conversion" to love is a __hymn__ sung by antigone, in an orchard, with other women; antigone explains to her that love can be __virtuous__, holy.

1022. while criseyda has a dream about "an egle" piercing her heart, troilus receives the good news from pandarus.

	- the motif of __historical repetition__ should be examined here; now troilus has compared his current happiness to that which "a thousand troyes" wouldn't be able to grant him.

	- the language that the men use is, in itself, __more violent__, graphic [perhaps military?].

	- pandarus prepares a plan: troilus should write a letter, and ride by cryseide's window. __active performance__ [there are insistent recommendations against sloth].

1092. pandarus gives troilus __detailed rhetorical advice__ about how to write a love letter; the letter is then quoted in indirect form - as a series of __actions__. a paraphrasis; he does not forget to add his tears to the envelope (performance); it looks like the __template__ of a letter.

1225. pandarus visits criseyde; we are reminded that he has a love story too, which does not progress; he takes criseyde aside with the __pretext__ of news from the greek camp; then he gives her the letter, with another __threat__ about troilus' death; she eventually accepts it, and she finds nothing wrong with it as she reads. advised by pandarus, she writes an answer, which the poet reports, again, in an __indirect speech__; she will be a "suster" for him.

1323. pandarus has staged the __window scene__ again [repetition]; right before that, he has recommended to criseyde that she should stop resisting, and enjoy the love. the display, its __repetition__ - is effective; she agrees.

1540. she agrees to respond to his wooing with her __sight__; after having read her letter, troilus grows __impatient__; pandarus responds to this condition by suggesting a __personal meeting__; he uses __personifications__ from the _roman de la rose_ to describe the need for it ["daunger"]; they need to ___chop her will down__. to accomplish their plan, pandarus goes to seek deiphebus' assistance; he creates __another fiction__, this time about a man trying to steal criseyde's inheritance. he organizes a meeting at his house, moving back and forth; the final detail of his plan is that troilus feigns __sickness__.

1755. at deiphebus' house, troilus manages to feign his sickness effectively; it is partly true, and caused by love, as he explains. pandarus is able to orchestrate the conversation of the whole group as well, from the praise of troilus to the scorn for criseyde's enemy [it is the triumph of pandarus' rhetorical ability to manipulate his interlocutors]. thanks to a __new fabrication__ - a false letter [possibly not false; certainly conveniently placed here] - troilus is eventually alone with criseyde. everybody reads.
