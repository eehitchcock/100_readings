##Ideas

- The Franklin's tale is the one about the rocks preventing the knight from returning to his wife; a squire who wooes the woman makes them disappear, thanks to a clerk. It ends with the annulment of a series of social contracts binding each character to the other (debts).

##introduction

- there was probably no interruption between the end of fr. iv and the beginning of fr. v; most manuscrpits present them as a single, continuous whole. squire after __merchant__ [his tale was the one about januarie and the pear tree].

- the squire's tale is a romance full of promise; its fantastical approach to the genre was fashionable at the time ["magic that works," cooper would say]. it is slow in its exposition, probably __deliberately unfinished__.

- the franklin's tale seems to resume the discussion of marriage. it is a __breton lay__, although it has no breton antecedents, and its source is boccaccio (filocolo and decameron); besides, it focuses on __mariage__ and has little __supernatural__ elements [they are all explained pseudoscientifically], and on "troth."

##the squire's tale

8. the squier is asked to "sey somwhat of love" by the host; he agrees, apologizing for his "amys" style [the discussion on style was already present in the inversion between genre and decorum attempted by the clerk and the merchant].

211. the setting of the tale is the european east, "the land of tartarye"; here everything is __hyperbolically__ excellent and beautiful (the triumph of exotism); the richness of this setting contrasts with the constantly __apologetic tone__ of the narrator, who deems himself uncapable of expressing its true beauty. we find here a __sumptuous feast__; like in _sggk_, the celebration is interrupted by the arrival of an __unexpected knight__, who brings with himself precious gifts from "arabe" and "inde" [more exotic than the exotic; this seems to answer cooper's question about the limits of wonder, the fact that wonder by definition has to be constantly overcome]; according to the squire, his __rhetorical abilities__ are another marvel [like those of gawain himself]. the first gift is a "steede of bras" that can travel anywhere; the second a mirror of prophecy; the third a ring to understand beasts; the fourth an invincible sword [all the ingredients of romance - travel, romance _eros; the mirror can show you your "newe love",_ nature, war]. the horse produces most wonder.

408. the poet reports the astonished reactions and murmurs of the people witnessing the scene; they use __different textual traditions__ to explain these wonders (scientific, philosophical, mythical); __accumulation of references__, potentially pointless (another hyperbole [analogies with chaunticleer, with the monk, and with the whole seventh fragment]). now the king retires to a room where people play celestial music (everything is __heavenly__; [suggestion of an allegorical value, perhaps]); again the squire uses the trope of __ineffability__ in an __apologetic__ way. the greatest "wondrying" is again the horse, whose mechanism the knight now explains - it reacts to the "trilling" of some of its pins, accompanied by __verbal instructions__ [the knight emphasizes the "ere" of the animal]. after dinner, they all go to sleep; the poet's attention now focuses on the princess, excited for the gifts; she wakes up before dawn, to have a walk outside; she seems possessed by __exceptional energy [vitality]__, the __liveliness__ of young blood.

	- as he explains that she can understand the birds, the squire includes a __digression against digressions__ [he is rushing, and paradoxically not rushing, towards the core of his tale; _is the ring a ring of interpretation?_ a ring that allows us to read beyond the literal, the primary meaning, the signifiers, to access the actual signified found in nature? how is it in contrast with the communication - mechanical, artificial, insincere - happening between the horse and the rest of the court - the __wonder that everybody is attracted to__, compared to the wonder that __nobody looks at__, and that is paradoxically more important?].

601. the real "knotte" of the tale, then, is a "faucun," crying in a piteous voice, beaten with her own wings, pierced with her beak; an image of __compassion__, irresistible; for now this compassion is caused solely by __nonverbal elements__ - such as, for instance, the __ineffable__ "fairnesse" of the faucon, such a wonder for which, perhaps, no words at all would be adequate. thanks to the ring, the two can start speaking; and the first few words seem to evoke _dante_ - "that ye be in this furial pyne of helle?"; the woman insists on the vocabulary of "__compassioun__" [the bird keeps swooning - another dantean reference?]; the bird does the same. after her upbringing, she was seduced by a deceiving tercelet, a "feende" in disguise [these are the same animals of _parliament of fowls_]; after a long wooing, she __submitted__ to his will; their "marriage" lasts two years; then he has to leave [the reasons are not explained fully; many connections with the marriage group].

708. although they had promised to love each other, the tercelet is actually seeking a new love; here we find the same image that will later be used, in a more explicitly antiboethian fashion, by the _manciple_ - a bird cannot remain in its cage if let free, no matter how pleasant this [the cage] is; thus, he suddeny falls in love with another "kyte." the women feel, again, great empathy for the bird [this is, __also__, a metaphor for reading; remember that inferno v is, __also__, a great canto about reading; about the way in which we are moved by what we read]; the girl brings her [the bird] with her to the palace, and there she tries to heal her. the squire then interrupts this side of the story to anticipate the many "aventures" and "batailles" that will follow; but his story is interrupted by the "frankeleyn" (he is the __glutton__ landowner in the _g. p._), who paradoxically praises his good style and tells him that, despite his youth, he has a __promising skill__ [_remember that the praise could be for chaucer himself_], which he compares with those of his __rebuked son__ [this is a crucial connection, yet mysterious in its full implications], lacking in __virtues__ (a small dark detail; remember that the squire is the knight's son [what is this digression referring to, then? the wish of small aristocracy to repossess the lost ideals of romance through its lowest examples? who is the franklin's son?]). he will tell his tale.

##The franklin's prologue and tale

900. the franklin uses the __introduction__ of a __breton lay__, anticipating a __translation__; but then he specifies that, lacking the skills of a __rhetorician__ [consistently with his praise of the squire], he will tell his tale in a "bare and pleyn" style. the tale begins with an __ideal marriage__, where the husband, although uncapable of granting the woman the entirety of her __soveraynetee__, is willing to obey to her, and never impose his jealousy or "__maistrie__" against her. maistrie is, indeed, the franklin's explicit adversary - since "love is a thyng as any spirit free" [love is about decision]; its __positive contrary__ is "pacience" (the same praised in the _clerk's tale_); their [the couple's] perfect bliss is finally defined as a __combination of "lordshipe" and "servage__." following the conventions of the genre, the knight is then summoned to "engelond," where he spends two years to seek "worshipe and honour"; but, instead of following him, the poet's attention focuses on the lonely wife, who longs for him [like the bird in the squire's tale; _here we find a sequence of verbs defining the very active quality of her grief_]; she is eventually conoled by "hire freendes." but the poet then reports her __philosophical monologue__ about the mystery of evil [_why do bad things happen to virtuous people?_] - prompted by her observation of the dangerous black rocks that draw sailors to death, on her [land's] shores [the choice of these rocks is half philosophical and half concrete; on the one hand, they embody the unexpectedness of evil occurring to the ships which, like virtuous lives, try to reach their destinations; on the other hand, from a very practical standpoint, they are the obstacle that might turn the return of her husband into a tragic ending].

1100. the friends keep trying to console her with __distractions__; now they are in a beautiful __garden__, the quintessential __locus amoenus__, where a _curteous squire_ [the emblem of courtly love, then; the garden stands for sexual desire, just like in the merchant's tale; _remember how the franklin had praised the actual squire_] sings and dances to entertain the group; we are told that he has loved her for two years, confessing his feelings only under the __concealment of arts__ - singing __poems__ and dancing for her [he is truly the embodiment of "courtly love" in romance, just like the actual squire]. he eventually confesses his love; she refuses it; but then - in __jest__ [words understood literally, where a metaphorical or ironical meaning should instead be preferred] - tells him that she will agree if he will be able to remove "alle the rockes" from the shores of "britayne" [the tone seems highly philosophical; _as if the lady was explicitly using a metaphor here, that the squire understands - instead - literally; just the same sort of displacement of meaning that kay finds in romance - allegorical love understood literally_]. upset, the squire complains in a long monologue, which then becomes a prayer to the goddess of the moon, asking her to drown the rocks by affecting the ebbs of the sea [the style is again __measured__ and refined; a combination of __epic, lyric, and philosophical__ - high register]. in the meanwhile, the husband has joyfully returned.

1296. the squire's brother, a clerk, remembers having seen a book of "magyk naturel" concerning the operations of the moon - now "folye" replaced by "hooly chirches feith" [like the fairies at the beginning of the wife of bath's tale; _the speculative space of romance is always justified by its remoteness in time_]. the two travel to "oriens", to find a clerk that might help them concoct an __illusion__; "revel" evoked by his "magyk." he accepts to help them - for "a thousand pound"- and they travel back to "britaigne"; here the franklin inserts a short and lyrical description of winter. [the tone is ambiguous: the franklin has to be constantly __skeptical__ of what he describes; _why? because of the presence of magyk? because of the moral implications? because of the genre?_]. the illusion is performed.

1498. the squire communicates the accomplishment to the lady; she despairs [the tone - the very phrases - are the same used for her longing, while the husband was away]; then the poet reports a __long direct monologue__ where she considers the option of killing herself, quoting __many literary exempla__ [the style is definitely high; and __devoid of psychological realism__; _unlike, say, the clerk's tale_]; there is even an __excess of literary references__, some of which are obscure, others perhaps __irrelevant__ [she is applying a __literary tradition__ to her own experience; not dissimilar from her choice of embodying her sorrow into the black rocks - an __allegory in practice__, and a dangerous lie - like the magician's illusions; indeed, like there, here her __intimate space__ seems to be populated by non-existent characters; _how is the magician similar to the lady, and to the very narrator of the story, is an obvious question; but perhaps still worth asking; what is their ethical stance at that point?_]. she confesses her pledge to her husband; he is initially calm, and tells her that she should keep her "trouthe" [trouthe, like in _a. & a._, is also a correspondence between __signifier__ and __signified__], because it is the most important thing; but then, bursting into tears, he forbids her to tell anyone about her pledge, and he sends her away [_she will still have to do what the squire asks for_; his reaction seems more sincere than hers].

1624. having run into her, the squire is told about her husband's decision, and he is moved by his loyalty - he feels "greet __compassioun__" [a strong force in the squire's tale as well] for the griefe caused by his lust - and he decides to release her from her __treuthe__ - "kan a squier doon a gentil dede | as wel as kan a knyght, withouten drede." the marriage is saved, and the two lovers live happily ever after; later, having confesssed the story to the clerk - and meaning to pay him for his magyk, the squire is released from his debt too. "but if a clerk koude doon a gentil dede" - __socially contagious gentilesse__ [and a solution accomplished not through the application of literary models, or illusion, but by concrete compassion - compassion triggered by a series of transactions]. the franklin concludes his story by asking his public - "which was the mooste fre"; a problematic question. [could we say that the lady was the least fre?]
