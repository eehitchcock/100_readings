##Introduction

- john lydgate was a benedectine monk in suffolk; the work was committed by henry, prince of wales, and completed between 1412 and 1420; it is a __translation__ and __expansion__ of guido delle colonne's "historia," influenced by __chaucer's troilus__ (it is in five books as well, _rather than the 35 of guido's version_); the story is reorganized and expanded with __additional sources__.

	- _the book adapts to the scope of Guido's historia quite closely, from the "origins of the war in Jason's quest for the golden fleece" to the war itself and the tragic returns of the greek heroes._

	- the book was very popular and influential in the later middle ages.

	- the _troy narrative_ was both a _resonating historical event_ and a model or source of moral teachings; lydgate seems to emphasize the latter; it is an __exemplary__ and __moralizing__ narrative (for these two aspects, focus on the introduction and the conclusion, and perhaps consider how they are treated in _the idea of the vernacular_); lydgate occasionally focuses on virtues that might especially benefit a leader, such as prudence.

	- manuscripts of the poem emphasized both its status as a __prestige item__ and the __importance__ of its moralizing remarks, with ad hoc annotations and manicules; these editorial features, together with the history of its commission from the future king henry v, make the book a "__public poem__," written for __national prestige__ and to defend __lancastrian interests__.

	- the book has an __encyclopedic quality__; its most recurrent device is __learned amplification__.

	- the explicit presence of chaucer as the father of english literature, a sort of __literary fiction__ for the time, seems part of the nationalistic project of the book; lydgate treats him with the deference with which he (chaucer) treated his __auctores__; the core of this process is, predictably, the treatment of the __troilus subplot__, retold, expanded, and multiplied in lydgate's telling of the tragedy.

	- the stle is also indebted to chaucer, deploying the same couplets of the canterbury tales, and the rime royal of his other works in the envoy; but lydgate's poetry is also latinate and therefore syntactically convoluted, deploying latin constructions and borrowing latin words.

	- the text survives in twenty-three manuscripts and fragments, some of which are elaborately decorated.

##Commentary

- _prologue_.

	- the poem starts with an invocation of __mars__; but this is immediately followed by several other mythical figures and references, from the muses of parnase to christine's "epistre othea"; he also refers to vegetius; the frame is therefore immediately that of the __education of a warrior and a ruler__ - the pedagogical system of __chivalrie__ (and the corresponding __moral__ implications_); lydgate explains the commission, to the prince of wales, and lists the sources - guido's version and the subsequent __latin__ and __french__ retellings of the same narrative.

	- lydgate presents a system of __memory__ and __education__ enacted through the relationship between __history__ and __literature__; books ought to report the __truth__ in order to be profitable for generations of readers and writers; writing is a mirror of experience, left by past authors; for lydgate the purpose of classical tradition is explicitly __educational__; translatio studii is the history of that original knowledge, here exemplarily outlined by __lydgate__; he lists every relevant author working after homer, and until guido, his source.

1. _book 1_.	

	- the text works as an __annotation of itself__; the first few lines explicitly suggest that the reader read the same stories in __guido__ and in __ovid__; the model, highly intertextual, might be ovid itself - a book of __myths__, interwoven by a __cunning__ narrator; the actual narrative starts with the argonauts; but the flashbacks are juxtaposed with __meditations__ on fortune, god's providence, and proleptic sections where the narrator foresees the ending of his own narrative and what will happen after that - __aeneas__, brutus, and britain itself (the __translatio imperii___ as the fulfilment of god's will ; no better example than its original source, the story of all stories - troy; __the story of troy is the very essence of translatio imperii for lydgate__); we find chaucerian tropes in the treatment of the matter - the trembling hand holding the pen, between __knowledge__ and __inevitability__.

2. _book 2_.

	- the book starts with a reference to __fortune__ (this is perhaps the strongly moralizing aspect of the work, its traditional references to changing fortune and divine providence; lydgate decries the paucity of vernacular - his vernacular, like usk - as he translates from guido's latin; he uses the metaphor of __painting__; he then moves to the description of how troy was __built__ (clear parallel _between literary construction and architectural construction; an expansion of a trope found in chaucer's troilus_). 

3. _book 3_.

	- here we find one of the __authorizing__ references to chaucer; the poet wishes that he was still alive, to correct him.

	- unlike in chaucer, here we see __troilus__ fighting often; in this book we find his __tragedy__, although, again, lydgate stops to refer to chaucer (_to encourage his reader to access another section of the library and read more from the tradition_); he seems willing to emphasize the __misogynistic__ reading of the story, occasionally displacing it to __guido__.

4. _book 4_.

	- tragedy and most of the __troilus__ occur in the middle of the story, which therefore seems an expansion of chaucer's structure; fortune always affects the events.

5. _book 5_.

	- as the conflict ends, lydgate's translation starts pointing in __new directions__ - ulysses' travels and penelope's steadfast love for him; phtrryus's line and murder by orestes.

	- in the conclusion lydgate tells a sort of boethian dream, a __personification__ visiting ulysses, and telling him his destiny (the past of the __odyssey__, known to the present lydgate, a future event for the character of the poem); in the conclusion of his story with the reconciliation of his two sons, we se a chance for __collective__ peace (_the wish for peace, in the present tragedy of the hundred years' war, is another facet of the translatio imperii, paradoxically not that of an elected people, but that of europe as a whole_).

	- after the end of the story, lydgate abruptly jumps ahead in time (here the comparison with the eternalizing, atemporal conclusion of _troilus_ is certainly fitting - but lydgate seems to go in the opposite direction, immanent and temporal) to return to the present of __henry the fifth__, ruling on the island colonized by brutus; he seems to identify the trojan conflict with the hundred years' war.

	- the conclusion again states lydgate's project and commission; a pedagogical, exemplary book modeled after chaucer; we find an invocation to jesus and the king.

- _envoy_.

	- the only section in rime royal; explicitly addressed to the king, as an accomplishment to the book's journey to him; we find more __christian undertones__, and a strong __moral purpose__ (_it is worth considering, then the importance of the stanza in this circumstance_).
