#Rosalind Field: Romance in Egland (from The Cambridge Hisory of Medieval English Literature)

162. field uses pearsall's simple definition "__the principal secular literature of entertainment in the middle ages__"; she emphasizes its __recreational function__ [distinct from helen cooper and, partly, sarah kay.
	
	- the romance genre adheres to a __program of assimilation__ of __distinct sources__ (french, english, latin; _like for hiatt, it is a generative genre, a genre based on transformations, translations and incorporations that occur at the margins, from elsewhere into the country and its literary heritage_); it presupposed __bi__ or __tri-lingual__ authors [taste for __translation__, for the pre-existing, already heard story; the starting point is the __norman conquest__ - a french courtly world encountering a __culture__, anglo-saxon, that valued __vernacular writing__ enormously; old stories __adapted__ and __transcribed__ for a __new public__; in this context the __chansons de geste__ remained immensely popular, being __transcribed__ and __read__ for a long time after their continental reception; another influence was the latin and the vernacular __historiography__.

	- __anglo-norman romance__ was produced mostly between __1150 and 1230__, the period when __insular nobility__ became __independent__ from its continental roots.

	- the __tristan__ by thomas is perhaps the __definition__ of the genre in england; it is __dense__ and __ethically problematic__.

	- a distinct example is the __romance of horn__, written in __laisses__ and attempting a combination of __courtly romance__ and epic __chanson de geste__; it is sophisticated and was probably __popular__.

	- field keeps discussing examples of anglo-norman romances to show the variety of their influences and scopes; some are more __insular and epic__, others more __continental and erotic__.

	- the most characteristic feature of anglo-norman romance is __length__; they are ___excessive narratives__, focused on one single, unified story (not episodic, like chretien).

	- many of these anglo-norman works seem concerned with the creation of an __anti-tristan__ ehtical model [a very important detail], antithetical to the dangerous and __antisocial__ project of that earlier piece; in general, these poems have a tendency to __respond to each other__, and display a common readership and authorship.

	- another common trait is the use of "__deductive humor__" and __indecorous detail__" [such as the __explicitly erotic__ desire felt by the ladies who see horn at court; more of these are possibly in the middle english _sir tristrem_].

	- many of these works, besides, have __named authors__, an uncommon trait in other contexts.

	- finally, the anglo-norman genre avoids the arthurian cycle, focusing on __individuals__ rather than groups [the nobility probably did not enjoy stories about __monarchs__; _notice how the problem is later reverted in the alliterative morte arthur, a celebration of british monarchy and its imperialist dream_]; the focus is usually on __family and lineage__, and the __agnition__ of rulers, in a __vividly insular setting__ [these elements anticipate those of, for instance, havelok the dane].

176. these poems in anglo-norman were widely read in __the xiii and xiv s.__ [notice the late date]; continental poems (chretien's) were mostly read in the __royal court__, whereas __provincial audiences__ preferred the __anglo-norman__ ones; similarly, the chansons were still read in the xiv s.

	- the xiv s. sees __the first middle english romances__, such as the __exotic__ "floris and blancheflour" (in a way antithetical to the local and historiographical _king horn_), or the many adaptations of earlier anglo-norman texts.

	- the __havelok__ has two anglo-norman antecedents; it is more explicitly __christian and english__; the __guy__ narrative became very popular; probably all the middle english romances have originals in anglo-norman.

	- many features of the __middle english versions__ (__shorter__ narratives, __anonymous__ authors, __absence of some courtly elements__) suggest a __change in audience__, broader and less aristocratic (including __country gentry__ and __city merchants__), certainly __more varied__.

	- attempts have beenmade to __structure the corpus__ of middle english romance according to form: __alliterative__, couplet, and tail-rhyme stanza (corresponding to __heroic__, __chivalric__, and __pious__ subject matters; examples of these three are _sir gawain_, _king horn_, and the _stanzaic guy of warwick_), with the last one being often favoured by __english writers__.

	- the __auchinleck__ ms. proves that these secular texts were deemed worthy of being collected and preserved.

	- in this context we see __more arthurian works__, although the core remains __french__; sggk and the alliterative morte are good examples of an english take on this continental subject; the carolingian "matter of france" was less developed; the roman matter was treated __unoriginally__; the rest of the works responded to a renovated interest in __exotic__ and __fantastic__ tales, and presented an __elaboration__ of values such as love and family, and a more conspicuous presence of __female protagonists__; besides a __stronger ethical stance__ which often mixes with __religious values__.

	- field's last distinction is between the __positive__ perspective of the latter developments of the genre (alliterative morte arthur) and the darker, more genuinely problematic __narratives__ of the xii s. arthurian matter.
