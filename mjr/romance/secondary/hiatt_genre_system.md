#Genre without system - Alfred Jiatt

- Hiatt starts by analyzing the jarring introduction of a "fish in bread sauce" in the first lines of a balade usually ascribed to chaucer - "to rosemunde"; it is the __insertion of a foreign object__ taken from "the market, the pantry, the economy"; the fish is then compared to an intrusive reference to "tristam"; the traditional romance here, another __foreign object__.

	- for hiatt, this is a moment of __ungenre__ - destabilization of traditional __generic categories__; it is an insertion that provokes __disorientation__.

1. _is there a fish in this text?_

	- the taxonomy of medieval genres has been problematic in every geographical context; genres were fluid and dependent on the __implicit contract__ of expectations established between __authors__ and __audiences__.

	- the understanding of a __system__ of __expectations__, no matter how flexible, is still faulty for hiatt; the critic claims that, in fact, there is __no system of genres__.

	- _medieval literary theory_ seems to __resist classification__; the definition of genres was, for hiatt, an intellectual literary exercise, a __tentative process__; at times the genre was used as a literary device in the production of a work (as a repository of forms and tropes), rather than for its prelimiary definition and subsequent identification; hiatt analyzes the __nomenclature of genres__.

2. _romance_.

	- hiatt explains that the term was applied to a broad variety of texts; the term is associated with __narrative production__; at times it implies __verse__, and certain kinds of content - _chivalry, history, and epic_.

	- some definitions of the genre emphasize its __chronological__ and __geographical__ propension (__translatio__), from east to west and from antiquity to contemporary conflicts; it is also a __multilingual__ - inherently multilingual - genre.

	- definitions of romance, then, often stress __heterogeneity__ and __scope__.

	- for hiatt, the very word romance is __generative__, as it crosses boundaries of __time__ and __space__; it embraces histories of foundation, redemption, and destruction.

	- the genre was also often identified with __instruction__, both "elevated and humble," and with the act of __reading__, silently or aloud - so much that the term can stand for the book itself - or for a generic "text" [_translation_ in origin, _pedagogy_ in purpose, and _readership_ in topic are therefore the three features identified by hiatt].

	- the genre, or the term, is also associated with __foreigness__ and with "border and cultural crossings, translations and transformations," in textual, sexual, and artefactual commerce; the word itself contains a reference to __rome__, and it is suggestively __french sounding__.

	- hiatt ends his description by reiterating how the category is "__unstable__ and __non-systematic__"; he uses the example of a will where the word is used for the gospels [possibly indicating the form - codex - or the language - french].

3. _balade_.

	- the term balade might seem to have embodied a more specific correspondence of form and content; but definitions of balade seemed to actually change constantly; for chaucer it seemed to have referred to "part or whole of a poem written in rhyme royal"; if it had a meaning for form, it probably did not dictate __content__; the term denotes "a complex interaction of written and oral."

4. _tragedye_.

	- this term too was deployed as an __alien genre__ [a mark of exotism, or strangeness]; hiatt cites the monk in chaucer's tales, whose short stories of fall from fortune are defined as tragedies; but later deployments of the term seem to have lost some of the most persistent associations (classical origin, serious content, lyric delivery, at times linked to the complaint); it was somehow opposed to __comedy__.

5. _without system_.

	- hiatt compares the production of literature to that of documents in the late middle ages; documents were produced __socially__, without a clean system of __conventions__ and __expectations__; literature was nonsystematic.

	- for hiatt, all references to this nomenclature - all explicit acknowledgements of genre - are actuallyt __ungenre__; they are destabilizing; genre in the middle ages seems always mixed - with the fundamentally mixed definition of romaunce as its quintessence.

	- genres always indicate passage and alliteration.
