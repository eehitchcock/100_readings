#Frank Kermode: Hoti's Business: Why are narratives obscure?

34. __parables__ are exemplary for their distinction between __primary and secondary meaning__ (literal/figurative; vehicle/tenor); they are __similitudes__ (_similes_, analogies); they share some features with __riddles__.

	- parables can be as short as maxims or riddles , which can be immediately __decyphered__ and __discarded__, their mystery solved by one simple answer; or as long as __short stories__, where the increased number of details, not all of them immediately relevant to the solution, adds a layer of __obscurity__ - narrativity entails a measure of __opacity__.

	- parables might be characterized by the fact that they constantly invite and __frustrate__ interpretation.

	- there are two ways to understand __evangelical parables__; they are told to __exclude__ "outsiders" [kermode's term] from __understanding__ - and salvation; or, they are told to make understanding, and salvation, accessible - although they might still be __misunderstood__; the contrast coincides with mark's and matthew's diverging accounts of the sower's parable.

		- this distinction seems relevant to some of the discussions about audience; would a sophisticated audience have been more able to detect the codified discourse of _fin amor_ in tristram, for instance - understanding it as a codified way to describe the clash between social and spiritual obligations? and, on the other hand, is the model of tales like _amis and amiloun_ or _havelok_ an open model, devised to include its audience?

		- and what about more problematic, late medieval texts, like chaucer's and sggk?

47. to exemplify the __inexhaustibility__ of interpretation of narratives, kermode lists some of the parable of the samaritan by the latin commentators, at the beginning and throughout the middle ages; they are __endless__ and all __true__. parables are simultaneous "__proclamation and concealment__."
