#Susan Crane: Insular Romance

##Introduction

12. crane starts by stressing __linguistic difference__: anglo-norman was a new dialect of __old french__, detached from the context, born in the decades of __1066__; romances written in this language, like the following __middle english versions__, constitute an __autonomous whole__; the conquerors and settlers slowly assimilated some of the __customs__ of the english peoples that they had submitted.

	- in 1154 henry ii, an angevin ruler, ascended to the throne, replacing the normans; this produced an even more profound __isolation__ from the continent; and a different __cultural__ and __social__ order.

	- works produced on the island differed from those produced for the angevin courts (henry ii, eleanor of aquitaine), among which we find __marie de france__, chretien, the romans d'antiquit√©.

	- crane therefore distinguishes between __continental works__, for the court, and __anglo-norman__ works, __insular__ in __taste and concerns__; __dialect__ is the strongest distinctive element [some analogies with the different audience described by field].

	- there were many levels of __linguistic interaction__ - dialect, bilingualism, and the artificial preservation of french; anglo-norman was spoken by the __aristocracy__, artificially preserved on the __island__ while scorned on the continent [marie de france's epiteth is chosen to emphasize her __linguistic diversity__ from the land where she writes].

	- the history of the __insular barony__ is crucial to this investigation; __barons__ were characterized as landowners, not as fighters, and they originally enjoyed a relatively peaceful, well organized __stability__; their power was __economical__ and __administrative__, not political, and generally concordant with the needs of the __monarchy__; one final - and __crucial__ feature was its __flexibility__ - __nobility__ was not necessarily __inherited__, and it depended on __capable administrative qualities__; barony was defined by ideals ("courtly" ideals), which were preserved and elaborated by literature.
	
	- the transition from anglo-norman to middle english is purely linguistic; neither social nor thematic.

	- crane's definition of the genre is broad and socially constructed - "storial thyng that toucheth gentlesse" is the definition of the __miller's tale__; they have __social preoccupations__, and meditate and reflect the role of the __individual__ within society.

	- one final strong influence was the role of the church.
