#Susan Crane: Insular Romance

|Key-words|Concepts|
|Translation; Idealism; Barony; |Insular romance is defined by _language_, then themes; the _barony_ was the audience and the concern of the genre - its power was economic and administrative (peaceful), not military; its power shifted during the xiii and xiv centuries, a shift that explains some of the changes between the a.n. and the m.e. versions.; the m.e. versions tend to be __collective__ and __socially conservative__; as they develop, they offer naturalistic models of exemplary behavior.|

##Introduction

12. crane starts by stressing __linguistic difference__: anglo-norman was a new dialect of __old french__, detached from the context, born in the decades of __1066__; romances written in this language, like the following __middle english versions__, constitute an __autonomous whole__; the conquerors and settlers slowly assimilated some of the __customs__ of the english peoples that they had submitted.

	- in 1154 henry ii, an angevin ruler, ascended to the throne, replacing the normans; this produced an even more profound __isolation__ from the continent; and a different __cultural__ and __social__ order.

	- works produced on the island differed from those produced for the angevin courts (henry ii, eleanor of aquitaine), among which we find __marie de france__, chretien, the romans d'antiquit√©.

	- crane therefore distinguishes between __continental works__, for the court, and __anglo-norman__ works, __insular__ in __taste and concerns__; __dialect__ is the strongest distinctive element [some analogies with the different audience described by field].

	- there were many levels of __linguistic interaction__ - dialect, bilingualism, and the artificial preservation of french; anglo-norman was spoken by the __aristocracy__, artificially preserved on the __island__ while scorned on the continent [marie de france's epiteth is chosen to emphasize her __linguistic diversity__ from the land where she writes].

	- the history of the __insular barony__ is crucial to this investigation; __barons__ were characterized as landowners, not as fighters, and they originally enjoyed a relatively peaceful, well organized __stability__; their power was __economical__ and __administrative__, not political, and generally concordant with the needs of the __monarchy__; one final - and __crucial__ feature was its __flexibility__ - __nobility__ was not necessarily __inherited__, and it depended on __capable administrative qualities__; barony was defined by ideals ("courtly" ideals), which were preserved and elaborated by literature.
	
	- the transition from anglo-norman to middle english is purely linguistic; neither social nor thematic.

	- crane's definition of the genre is broad and socially constructed - "storial thyng that toucheth gentlesse" is the definition of the __miller's tale__; they have __social preoccupations__, and meditate and reflect the role of the __individual__ within society.

	- one final strong influence was the role of the church.

##Chapter one: Romance of Land and Lineage

24. many anglo-norman romances focus on english heroes; these differ from the __antisocial__ and __asocial__ depiction of love in french poems, and instead present a hero who is well __integrated within society__, while at the same time being __exceptional__; their preoccupation is to show the __identity__ of __inherited power__ and __universal prosperity__ [but is there space for __discussion__ here?], and that their success can result in __order__ and __equilibrium__.

	- crane explains how __anglo-norman__ romances differ from __historiographical works__ which inspired them; histories and chronicles tried to justify william the conqueror's legitimacy on the throne; the romances addressed these issues __indirectly__ and more __broadly__; they were not written to address __specific circumstances__; among them we find _horn_ and _havelok_ [where __bloodline__ is supported by __efficient administrative qualities__, and __universal prosperity__, through the __exile-and-return pattern__].

	- the angevin rule diminished the power granted to the barony, who tried to find __legal ways__ to obtain more control; this culminated in the __magna charta__ of _1215_, whose principles lasted throughout the xiii, and slowly incorporated every layer of society, from the monarch to the local knights. this is mirrored by the anglo-norman and m. e. "english heroes."

40. _horn romance_ and _king horn_ are the first two examples considered by crane; they share the same __theme__ - family rights and feudal order - but they differ in __method__; the a.n is "__ornamental__ and __archaizing__ in style," _king horn_ is extremely __concise__, and reduced in social detail. the structure is roughly the same [expulsion-and-return, duplicated]; _horn_, the romance, seems to rely on __echo__ and __parallelism__ - slowly developed __narrative__ structure, with many __careful repetitions__; the "design of regaining lost social position is doubled in __motive__ - revenge and love."

	- repetition may serve as a counterpart for __hereditary transmission__ (horn is doubling his father), and __dynastic__ project; the form of the _romance of horn_ is __laisses__; but these are __modernized__ with __enjambements__ and __rhymes__, and yet a "__deliberate archaism__"; it is a __slow and elaborate narrative__.

	- _king horn_ omits all the __social details__, but it emphasizes __repetition__ and __many__ recurrent __formulas__; again, the __repetition__ may be a __soothing__ way to transmit notions of __equilibrium__; on the other hand, in the m.e. we have an __expansion__ of __pathos__ and __tragic tones__.

	- the _romance of horn_ describes horn's excellence in a specific set of __insular aristocratic__ activities; _king horn_, instead, uses __hyperboles__ that compare him with __natural forces__.

	- in _king horn_ the __erotic__ and the __military__ elements seem both subordinate to the establishment of his __dynastic__ power; the tone of the story, with a hero that __never__ changes, is one of "quiet inevitability"; horn is a hero from the very beginning (but don't his priorities __change__ over time?), a seed of his people, favored by providence.

52. the source of the a.n. _haveloc_ is an a.n. chronicle; there we found the story of a "__danish__ prince dispossessed in childhood and raised in england by his huardian grun." here too the "expulsion-and-return" pattern is developed in a legal sense [marriage, _the pledging of treuthe?_]; providence is again present as a __motif__, especially in the __marriage plot__ that brings the two lineages together.

	- the m.e. havelok describes the porousness of social interests shared by the nobility and the emerging __professional and middle classes__; havelok is a __model for all__, and for __broader social order__; he is also a model of __submission__ to the ruling classes.

	- the focus in havelok is on the __legality of good rule__ as a __global social bond__; it is not, like in horn, on providence; the change is justified by the loss of power experienced by the barony during the xiii s.; havelok the dane, besides, employs __pathos__ profusely.

##Chapter two: Land, lineage, and nation

67. the difference between the a.n. and m.e. versions of _guy_ and _beues of hampton_ are justified by changes in the __social and cultural context__ - not just __language__ (_versions_, not translations); beue and gui belong to the __second generation__ of a.n. "_english heroes_"; boeve closely resembles horn in plot; but a new element of __nationalism__ is emerging here, perhaps even emphasized over the baronial concern for __individual__ autonomy; __baronial rights__ remain, nevertheless, the __strongest component__; like his predecessors, guy defends __land rights__ - __national feelings are always stronger in the m.e. versions__.

91. one feature that characterizes this generation of heroes is the __reliance on the legal system__ as a way to solve disputes; often their rights are __defended__ against the __usurpations__ of kings; this attention to legal bondsis expressed through a __stronger emphasis on language__ [here we find the __cardinal equivalence__ between _truth_ - "meaning in language" - and "__trewthe__" - truth in law].

	- the __rhyme-tail__ stanza occasionally used in guy and beves has __national__ connotations.

	- insular romances of english heroes present a __collective social drama__, rather than the drama of __collectivity against the individual__; they also present a strong connection between the hero and his land; they are __socially conservative__.

##Chapter three: Religion in pious romances

117. moral and religious concerns are all insular features shared by __anglo-norman__ and __middle english__ works; occasionally, however, __religious preoccupations contrast with secular ones__ [1215 is both magna charta and iv lateran council!]. the clergy often condemned the __fictions__ of romances and the enjoyment people found in them; it should be remembered that the church was affecting people's lives more and more in this period [__inquisition__ was instituted in __1231__], in opposition to __secular institutions__

	- if the "__english heroes__" romances explore the relationship between __barony__ and __society__ from a __political__ and __legal__ perspective, the "__exemplary romances__" try to question and model __social behavior__ from a __religious__, yet non-ecclesiastical perspective; it is the domain where the genre confines with __hagiography__; the exemplary text, in this sense, is __guy of warwick__; if __hagiographies__ are founded on the contrast between __spiritual__ and __secular life__, a stark antithesis that prompts a choice, these romances instead try to __model an integration__ between the two [citizen of the church and citizen of the nation], where the hero maintains his __heroic identity__ and __autonomy of action__.

133. the versions of the _amis and amiloun_ story develop a transition from __secular__ to __spiritual__ perspectives, with the last works in the group being more strictly __hagiographical__; the a.n. and m.e. seem to constitute a whole. the a.n. version is __simpler__ and __narratively faster__; the m.e. has more details, and occasionally more __attentive__ treatment of the character's psychological world; the a.n. uses religious discourse as one among many elements of the plot; the m.e. describe sa __morally problematic__ context, where religion produces __doubt__; even the __radically violent__ cure for __leprosy__ suggested at the end had a __long textual tradition__, indicating that it was probably commonly believed effective; the leading move of these "__pious romances__," then, is the __substitution__ of "__human__ for __divine salvation__"; __social brotherhood__ is eventually more effective than __divine intervention__; they are both "__adaptive__" and "__resistent__" - they offer a __model__ where the world of immanence and the pursuit of transcendence __coexist__.

##chapter four: measuring conventions of courtliness

157. __love__ is a __political problem__ in the genre; these romances were addressing the __individual__ and __social__ adherence of their audience to the __ideals__ of _fin'amor_; insular romance in particular was initially __resistent__ to it [it should be remembered, however, that "__courtly love__" was not __one single code__, but many, often contrasting, models]. as in other circumstances, the insular versions strive to establis a __socially feasible version of love__ - not the antisocial adultery of tristan; with time, idealization of courtly practices found in early writings became a __social actuality__ in latter texts.

	- the _fin'amor_ found in __tristan__ is more than a plain "__negative exemplum__"; it is a refined, ethically elevating feeling that nevertheless results in __antisocial behavior__ and __pure idealization__; its __style is elaborate__, with __complex psychological arguments__ and __abstract explorations__; it is a __love narrative__ that incorporates __pain and death__, often meant as __parallels__ for __religious purification__. [his standpoint seems ultimately __ambiguous__; for crane, it celebrates love.]

174. similarly, hue de rotelande's "_ipomedon_" resists the ideals of _fine amor_ by _parodying_ their embodiment.

##Chapter five: adapting conventions of courtliness

198. in the __xiii__ and __xiv s.__ the ideals portrayed in __courtly romance__ became actual social models of __appropriate behavior__; the courtly aristocracy was looking for ways to distinguish itself from the rest of society. the question remained - how easily could these __values__ and __models__ be applied to persistent social practices? and could this model be extended __beyond baronial courts__? works prouced in the xiii respond differently to the __stark contrast__ between __idealized love__ and __social order__ of thomas' tristan; _adamas and idoyne_ presents a model where __tragic death__ is replaced by __adultery__ and __remarriage__; __sir tristrem__, a roughly simplified version of thomas, seems to __avoid__ "thomas's preoccupation with the problem of love" [the __love potion__, shared by the dog, is a good example - here the poet emphasizes both the __wonderful__ element and its __social inclusivity__, extended to the __animal companions__]; it is a __failed__ attempt to socially amend it.

215. in this period the __baronial aristocracy__ had started to __imitate chivalric values__; it was a __serious imitation__; an imitation that was slowly __acknowledged__ and __promoted__ by __literature itself__. in the genre of __romance__, this resulted in a __smoothing away__ of any __potential tension__ between __naturalism__ and __idealism__; insular romances are __accessible and didactic__, lending themselves to __imitation__; this means that later works are usually less problematic, some __naturalistic__ and clearly __exemplary__.

##Conclusion

223. __insular romances__ are uniquely preoccupied with __social and political__ issues; they present their __noble heroes'__ interests as inseparable from those of their __communities__; similarly, they __integrate secular and spiritual__ interests, and they __resist or mitigate__ the antisocial tendencies of "__courtoisie__," making it a more __worldly__ (or __human__) pursuit; they can be __universally exemplary__, a model for __mercantile__ classes as well, after the decline of barony.
