#helen cooper, the english romance in time

##introduction

15. the project is defined as a "__historical semantics__ of __romance motifs__." these motifs, for which cooper provides as her fist example the bear found in the _winter's tale_, could be compared to "__memes__" - they adapt and exist by themselves, beyond the texts that produced them [thus this is __more__ than simple source studies].

	- some features of romance made them especially fitting for __reappropriation__ and __reinterpretation__; one is, for instance, their __exotic__ or remote setting, both __spatially and chronologically__. these 500 years [of the existence of romance] were marked by __linguistic, political, and religious changes__.

	- romance perhaps started as a __model of salvation__ (order - disruption - trials - resurrection), but then int __incorporated__ different perspectives on the issue [glottonous text, then; becoming richer than what it was at the beginning].

	- romance was also a __native__ form [thus occasionally appropriate for nationalistic claims, especially against different languages or traditions].

	- romances were sites of __ideological exploration__; but they were also an __educational genre__.

	- cooper defines the genre through the __expectations__ that it might have prompted: __fictional__, __particular__ (non-geralizing, unlike allegory), __long__; then we have exotic settings; love and chivalry, and high-ranking characters [a crucial difference, especially against _fabliau_]; its themes would be ideals, and especially secular, and human perfectability within a social context.

	- another important element is, of course, the __vernacular__, which implied a specific __audience__ and subject matter (latin was for academic, clerical, theological discourse).

	- romances were probably written to be heard (__aurality__); very often, they were written to __prompt a debate__ about their true, inner sense (__sentence__); they engaged an "engaged reception" [and they were, therefore, enigmatic and ambiguous by definition; deliberately unresolved pieces of narrative].

	- motifs were useful for this __speculative subtlety__; __convention__ [a grammar of motifs usually associated to specific themes; arranging the motifs in a different way, finding new meanings or new connotations in their use, implied constructing new debates around their topics].

40. __convention__ is what makes us mostly aware of __variations__; cooper uses the example of __female beauty__, a motif that can always be finely modified.

	- the genre was developed when england and france were a single cultural unit, in the mid. xii s.; its starting point was probably _geoffrey of monmouth's "history of the kings of britain"_, from __1138__. to write a complete account of two millennia of history, monmouth introduced __legends__, such as that of _brutus_, the founder descended form aeneas, _leir_, and _arthur_.

	- the first actual romances were probably written in the __1150s__, and refer back to either geoffrey's legends or __classical antiquity__; their main distinguishing feature was the __vernacular__, together with an attention to __individuals__ rather than __groups__.

	- from the _romans d'antiquit√®_ to __chretien__; the motion is from east to west; another strong influence were the __breton lai__, from the collection of _marie de france_ (who lived and worked in england), to the _franklin's tale_ [which is a fake one].

	- _thomas_ is the poet to whom we owe the enduring fame of the __tristram narrative__; this influenced chretien's lancelot and later developments of the genre, where __magic__ matters for "what it _means_, not for what it _does_"; _tristram_ shaped __heterosexual love__ as a __secular ideal__, providing writers with __language__ and __motifs__ [to discuss it].

	- _floris and blancheflour_ was probably first composed in __arabic spain__; it introduced __saracens__ as the ubiquitous enemy of christianity.

	- the __matter of england__ has _horn_ and _havelok_ as its main examples.

	- the __auchinleck ms.__ is the earliest extant __anthology__ of the genre, containing sixteen romances.

	- __prose romance__ reached england late.

44. another example of a __motif__ and its evolution, for cooper, is the __knight__: __history__ [the roots are in an actual custom, or historical necessity] - __ideal__ [the element becomes a _meme_, gaining a life independent from its source] - __parody__ [the ideal becomes its reversal, especially as we reach the renaissance]; the knight was first a __historical necessity__ (crusades), then a __literary construct__, eventually an __anachronism__.

##chapter one: quest and pilgrimage

77. the __trial of virtue__ - its test [of virtue] in the __material world__ [the world of immanence, and sin] - can have two __symbolic counterparts__: __pilgrimage__ (in __allegory__), and __quest__ (in __romance__); the quest invites potentially __infinite__ deferral and __expansion__ [episodic nature], although it is the __informing principle__ of the genre; its beginning and its end [the frame; the frame, like in the _canterbury tales_, is an endless pilgrimage, whose duration in timelessness becomes almost metaphysical; within it, we can have an endless number of digression or episodes, which may or may not constitute progress for their character].

	- often the quest is only partially known to the knight; it is not lucidly expressed [_sggk_]; the quest is, therefore, a __quest for knowledge__ - and __self-knowledge__ (learning [to know what i am truly looking for; to know how to look for what i am looking for]).

	- according to cooper, romance always presents an __individual__ that somehow stands for a __community__; the knight is both __exceptional__ [better than the group] and __exemplary__ [like the group]; they always start from and return to a community; this shaped the __outward-and-return pattern__, which - as many others - was __symmetrical__; and reminiscent of __christian history__ (__fall__ and __redemption__).

	- romances can employ __symmetry__ in their form (__repetition__) or in their __content__ (__duplicity__ - like for _amis and amiloun_); english translations were often more __deliberate__ in following __symmetrical structures__.

	- another structural device most often found in english romances is the __interlace__ of characters and topics [like the bedroom and hunting scenes in _sggk_; _notice how this interlace presupposes an engaged and conspicuous narrator, like the pilgrims in chaucer, and an experienced audience, like the one of sggk_]; it is not the same as __parallelism__ [which presupposes similar connotations shared by different characters and circumstances; _the same on both sides_].

	- the main feature of a quest is __journey__ - a journey without a map; its quintessential symbol is the "__silva__" [this is an actual meme; _it is the opening of commedia, here clearly assimilated to the genre of romance_]; it is often juxtaposed with an __exotic otherness__, placed in mythical or highly suggestive [evocative] lands.

105. the quest of romance is often an __ethical__ one; its goal is often __desire__, or the __destruction of desire__ [this ambivalence is actually crucial; the two ideas are closely linked, of course, but it is as if romance was deliberately exploring their proximity]; its prompt is __fear__.

	- often the conclusion of the quest is __failure and repentance__, followed by __forgiveness__ - __sin and restoration__ [atonement, redemption; the model is, again, _sggk_; _one collateral claim here is, for instance, that sggk is not a reinvention or betrayal of romance; it is its essence, and it is perfectly consistent with its tradition_], not infallibility; if one emphasizes the __religious valence__ of this reading, romance becomes structurally almost __indistinguishable__ from its allegorical counterparts, __dream vision__ [pilgrimage as intersection _between the two genres; pilgrimage is the quest and the allegorical journey of the soul_].

##chapter two: providence and the sea

136. the __rudderless boat__ is a very ancient motif; cooper argues that, despite its __many connotations__, the phrases used to express it have always remained the same; she also argues that it might have a __historical foundation__ - the discarding of unwanted children in ancient societies, for political reasons, and according to the law.

	- the fact that the people on the boat usually __survive__ explains its success in romance [romance is about fortune], and its later interpretation as a symbol for __providence__.

	- the motif is often connected with issues of __lineage__ and dispossession; often, however, the person cast on a boat is a woman, possibly representing an __alternative lineage__ or a threat to the political order [_albina_; the _man of law's tale_]. the motif has many analogues in the __scriptures__ - noah, jonah, moses.

	- the opposite of these sails is the __ship without a crew__ which, by __magic__, can lead its passenger to the __right destination__. it is a __readable__ form of providence.

##chapter 3: magic that doesn't work

172. __marvels and magic__ are often promised, but seldom effectively delivered, in the world of romance [this could be the subtitle of the _squire's tale_]. often magic overlaps with the __exotic__ and the __unknown__ (both in geography and in science); often it is a __decorative__, not a substantial, element of the plot; to make the supernatural more striking, the natural, even __trivial__, must be emphasized [_this is a great chapter, by the way_].

	- cooper collects a series of examples where magic is effective because it is __not used__; marie de france, the rings of _horn_ and _floris and blancheflour_; it these cases the magic object becomes a __symbol__ rather than a __device__ [_sens_ is more important than _matiere_, and the __misuse of magic__ proves this; _that is, the fact that magic becomes an interpretive symbol rather than a narrative device_]; cooper insists that __magic as symbol__ was more common in __aristocratic versions__ [versions of romances written for educated, refined audiences]; __magic as wonder__ (working magic) in __popular ones__ [she uses the vanishing of the rocks in the _franklin's tale_ as an example].

	- the __girdle__ in _sggk_ is the example of a __conscious manipulation__ of this trope - it is a magic object that perhaps is not magic; that the knight might even refuse.

	- magic was also occasionally frowned upon in the real world; hence the __ambiguity__ [a passage that seems relevant only to later contexts].

##chapter 4: fairy monarchs, fairy mistresses

207. __fairies__ - fairy ladies, fairy lands - are the most deliberate and extreme embodiment of __otherness__; they are "unassimilable."

	- some fairies become humanized through history; it is the case, for instance, of morgan le fay [this is the meaning of her name].

	- the quintessential fairy mistress is probably the one who seduces _lanval_, in _mdf_ and subsequent versions.

	- the __prophetic__ abilities of fairies are probably what chaucer had in mind when he had the "king of fayerye," pluto, grant the sense of sight to januarius, in the _merchant's tale_.

	- fairies are also often set to __test the faithfulness__ of knights - their "__treuthe__"; such is the case of sir orfeo's interaction with the king of fairies, or the rapist knight's promise to the old wyf in the _wife of bath's tale_; the fairies were therefore deemed capable of a __strong ethical judgement__ of humans [they seem _almost gods_].

217. "material and territorial" power is one of the __extraordinary features__ of fairies; at times, like in lanval, they could provide infinite riches to humans; and, like in sir orfeo, they have often __unlimited power__ over them.

	- finally, fairies can stand for the __danger of sexual desire__.

##chapter 5: desirable desire

240. romance is the first genre to consistently address __female virtue__ and __Female desire__; a positive female character is usually the condition for a happy ending. in women we found the formulation of __sexual desire__, and its embodiment in "fin amor."

	- cooper here has an __elaborate argument__ to prove the __connection between fin'amor and procreation__ - love was required in the preservation of heritage because, according to a widespread belief, only mutual pleasure caused procreation.

	- romance was often used as a way to explore __fantasies of female desire__; or, rather, fantasies about the freedom to love and pursue desire; women are shown to be able to __choose__ and woo - and be wooed - by the male hero.

	- the __interior monologue__ concerning the woman's feelings originated in romance; it started with the _roman d'eneas_; we find it in _thomas' tristran_ and in chaucer's _troilus_; these explore __female gaze and desire__, in detail.

268. romance was, therefore, one of the many genres devoted to the exploration of __human sexuality and marriage__; moderation and the ubiquity of natural forces - occasionally dangerous; the other genre was __allegory__; sex and marriage had to be regulated; __heterosexual love__ needed a norm [this is more or less what kay is arguing; cooper emphasizes the importance of a narrative, and therefore debatable and problematic, approach to the issue; _debate_ is the key notion of her entire argument].

##chapter 6: women on trial

292. how did romance address __misogyny__? [one feature of romance that this text is emphasizing: its __strong moral focus__, achieved by employing an apparently __amoral narrator__ - one that does not judge the object of the tale, nor does one comment on it.]

323. romances were __spaces for devate__; positive depictions of women were juxtaposed with negative ones; consider, for instance, the evil mother-in-law [figure] obsessively contrasted with cunstance in the _man of law's tale_.
