#helen cooper, the english romance in time

##introduction

15. the project is defined as a "__historical semantics__ of __romance motifs__." these motifs, for which cooper provides as her fist example the bear found in the _winter's tale_, could be compared to "__memes__" - they adapt and exist by themselves, beyond the texts that produced them [thus this is __more__ than simple source studies].

	- some features of romance made them especially fitting for __reappropriation__ and __reinterpretation__; one is, for instance, their __exotic__ or remote setting, both __spatially and chronologically__. these 500 years [of the existence of romance] were marked by __linguistic, political, and religious changes__.

	- romance perhaps started as a __model of salvation__ (order - disruption - trials - resurrection), but then int __incorporated__ different perspectives on the issue [glottonous text, then; becoming richer than what it was at the beginning].

	- romance was also a __native__ form [thus occasionally appropriate for nationalistic claims, especially against different languages or traditions].

	- romances were sites of __ideological exploration__; but they were also an __educational genre__.

	- cooper defines the genre through the __expectations__ that it might have prompted: __fictional__, __particular__ (non-geralizing, unlike allegory), __long__; then we have exotic settings; love and chivalry, and high-ranking characters [a crucial difference, especially against _fabliau_]; its themes would be ideals, and especially secular, and human perfectability within a social context.

	- another important element is, of course, the __vernacular__, which implied a specific __audience__ and subject matter (latin was for academic, clerical, theological discourse).

	- romances were probably written to be heard (__aurality__); very often, they were written to __prompt a debate__ about their true, inner sense (__sentence__); they engaged an "engaged reception" [and they were, therefore, enigmatic and ambiguous by definition; deliberately unresolved pieces of narrative].

	- motifs were useful for this __speculative subtlety__; __convention__ [a grammar of motifs usually associated to specific themes; arranging the motifs in a different way, finding new meanings or new connotations in their use, implied constructing new debates around their topics].

40. __convention__ is what makes us mostly aware of __variations__; cooper uses the example of __female beauty__, a motif that can always be finely modified.

	- the genre was developed when england and france were a single cultural unit, in the mid. xii s.; its starting point was probably _geoffrey of monmouth's "history of the kings of britain"_, from __1138__. to write a complete account of two millennia of history, monmouth introduced __legends__, such as that of _brutus_, the founder descended form aeneas, _leir_, and _arthur_.

	- the first actual romances were probably written in the 1150s, and refer back to either geoffrey's legends or __classical antiquity__; their main distinguishing feature was the __vernacular__, together with an attention to __individuals__ rather than __groups__.

	- from the _romans d'antiquit√®_ to __chretien__; the motion is from east to west; another strong influence were the __breton lai__, from the collection of _marie de france_ (who lived and worked in england), to the _franklin's tale_.

	- _thomas_ is the poet to whom we owe the enduring fame of the __tristram narrative__; this infl
