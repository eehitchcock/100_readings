#sarah kay, _courts, clerks and courtly love_

87. the phrase "__courtly love__" was coined in 1883; it has produced the impression that the concept associated to it could be "susceptible of codification" [as a system of norms]; but kay's argument is that it was, instead, a "__a series of questions__," not a "system of rules and doctrines"; the relationship between __courtly literature__ and __courtly society__ is often __problematic__.

	- to describe the __complex interaction__ between __history__ and __fiction__, kay uses the example of _lancelot_, commissioned to chretien as a praise of _adulterous love_ from the same lady [marie de champagne] whose lover, at that time, was being condemned for adultery to death; they may represent __fantasies__, certainly not reality.

	- the interaction was __problematic__ between the different people involved too - the __writer__, the __patron__, their goals (religious allegory, courtly entertainment).

	- _lancelot_ is the __paradigm of courtly love__, understood as a __metaphor for submission__ to an __ideological or political__ entity.

	- the term used in the m. ages was __fin'amor__ (occitan); this was not courtly by definition - it could act in __opposition__ to the principles established by the court - "__asocial or even antisocial__."

	- according to kay, medieval texts were constantly addressing the __tensions__ implicit in the __definition of love__, while trying to __conceal__ (mask) them [this is cooper's argument about romance in general, although the concealment part is less stressed there].

	- in the __mid. xii s.__, the aristocratic court started incorporating a "__lay department__" of bureaucracy and administration, alongside a "__clerical__" one - __religious__ by background [__clerks__]; this fostered an __interaction__ between __holy__ and __lay__ perspectives; __love__, both social and antisocial, was at its core [is this analogous to the __contemplativa__/__activa__ dialectic? _love is crucial because, together with death, it is shared by humans and the rest of nature; it is politically connected to the problem of lineage and power]; chretien, between holy _perceval_ and lay _lancelot_ [_explored specifically this dynamic in his two unfinished works_].

96. the __twelfth century__ was the "__age of ovid__"; ovid was also cardinal to the idea that love was a __literary construct__, and a __performative__ one; ovid was especially influential in the decades __1150-1170__, when the _roman d'eneas_ was composed - the xii s. renaissance; the eneas was the prototype of romance, starting with chretien's cliges, which seemed to explore the __broad contradiction__ between __social reality__ and __high ideals__.

	- the _tristan_ is the __antithesis__ to the positively resolved contradiction of _eneas_ ("domesticated passion"); it comes from __celtic__, not classical traditions; it is somehow __magical and fatalistic__ [_not providential_]; it depicts a love that is as intense and totalizing as religion - where the lover, like lancelot, is "__simultaneously sublime and degraded__."

	- _eneas_, therefore, constituted the model of __love and marriage__; _tristan_ that of __love and adultery__; a good site to explore this __dichotomy__ is the _flamenca_, or the "_roman de la rose_."

	- "is sex religious, or can sex be religious?" are some of the questions asked by romances [sex, and adultery, is both limits of the spectrum that identifies love and religion; its most radical manifestation and its complete denial]; at times, like for _thomas_, the position of the writer is __debatable__ (is he disapproving of what his romance is telling?) - as kay reminds us [at times, as cooper explains, it even disappears, to leave space for debate].


	- __courtly clerks__ explore tensions [this social role, in its interactions with the secular world, was born then] - act. cont. [that is, tensions that will be later identified, perhaps, with the contrast between _vita activa_ and _vita contemplativa_].
