#Sir Tristrem

##Introduction

- the origin of the story, according to this editor, is celtic. like for _floris and blancheflour_, traditional criticism has identified a common and a courtly version of the story.

- the anglo-norman tristan (of which we only possess about one sixth of the original) belongs to the courtly category (1170). the m.e. tristrem, from the late s. xiii, could also be considered as an __adaptation__ of thomas's poem [as from prof. crane says, there has been consistent debate about the sources available to the m. e. poet; he may or may not have had a ms. version available; he might have also reconstructed the original from his memory].

- the m.e. tristrem only survives in the __auchinleck ms.__, together with 17 other romances.

- the language of the poem is remarkable; it combines northern and non-northern forms; it has been debated whether the poem should be considered scottish, northern, or southern.

- the relationship between the original and the m. e. is also problematic. the editor of teams considers it a parody; others see it as a poorer translation.

- form: short lines, in a complex stanza, with only two alternating rhymes (between six and seven syllables - three feet? - and one shorter line - two syllables) [11-line stanzas, rhyming ababababcbc].

##Comment

110. the poet spoke with thomas and read in a poem about the hero of his story; he will now tell it as it was told "in toun." it is the story of a __faded era__; the story starts with a contrast between roland and morgan - an endless battle that eventually reaches the shores of england, from brittaby. there, in a turnament against his enemy, roland dies, leaving beyond a woman, blancheflour [she dies in childbirth], and a child, tristrem.

	- brittaby is the land of war; england, ruled by markes, is where the conflict finds a __peaceful resolution__. nevertheless, this resolution is __tragic__; blancheflour "hears" this news [there is, in this initial section of the poem, a strong emphasis on _rumors_ as witnesses of historical facts].

220. roland and his men are now travelling towards another land, to rescue blancheflour; the __exposition__ here is very __fragmentary__ [elliptical and repetitive, at times strangely insistent on marginal, apparently irrelevant details]. it is apparently a second telling of the same episode. roland dies again; again the news about his death reach blancheflour, who gives birth to tristrem [and dies]. it is a __puzzling repetition__ [or it may look as a repetition, even though it is not] - perhaps connected to the __oral form__ [a motif within the text and a feature of the text itself]?

341. tristram was apparently born from an adulterous affair, which roland confessed to his actual wife only while dying [again, not sure about this detail]. the exposition is again - __problematic__. the name of the protagonist is told through a a __similar inversion__ (_usteron proteron_): "tho trem bifor the trist." the child has an exceptionally strong education - and, as we learn now - roland is not dead yet; he educates him. the child wins many hawks at chess [against a number of mariners; the number and quality of the hawks is reported in detail, as is the quantity of the money waged].

	- the episode of the successful chess game seems a __sudden narrative pause__; the pace is [everywhere else] swift.

440. the mariners with whom he was playing kidnap him; but, hit by storms, they decide to leave him on a foreign shore [like horn].

	- the stanzas seem to compose a __song__; they are often __repetitive__, as if they contained __refrains__.

	- the poet keeps referring to thomas, as if he had been a __witness to the story__.

	- on the foreign shore, tristrem finds pilgrims from "yngland." he is dressed in a nice robe; strolling through a forest.

539. tristrem offers them money to be led to the king of the land in the forest outside the castle, he sees hunters and strangely dressed beasts - they are being skinned [another puzzling passage]. the hunter asks him to help them. we have a __detailed description__ of the quartering ["dressing"] of these animals ["game"], as if it was a foreign, strange process [very reminiscent of sggk]. he carefully splits organs and tissues, then distributes them as rewards for the hunters, the hounds, and even the crows witnessing the scene [strange __allegorical valence__? it has historical foundations, though]; then he asks them to blow their horn and alert the king. tristrem is interrogated by the monarch, who is impressed by his skills as a hunter [described as the skills of a __foreign land__].

638. at the court, tristrem is welcomed with a feast; he replaces the court's "harpour," and sings beautifully - this, and his clothes, are read as proof that he is a noble man; in the meanwile, roland [the steward] seeks tristrem everywhere, grieving for his loss; he eventually finds the two palmers, who lead bhim to the gates of the castle. there, however, the porter does not let him in; the token used by roland, a ring, is not recognized.

748. roland tries with __another ring__; it a strange take on the __motif of agnition__; the reason is probably that roland's clothes are tattered, and that his beard is long; he is brought to tristrem, who welcomes and kisses him; then after a bath and a shave [__deceiving appearances__, like in _sir orfeo_], he reveals his and tristrem's __identity__ to the king [he is not roland, tristram's father, but his steward].

880. __agnition__. tristrem is the king's nephew [another detail about which we are not entirely convinced]; he decides to travel to his land, to fight morgan. having been given an army, and having been dubbed a knight, he travels to ermione, and seeks morgan; the misssion is not a failure - tristrem is humiliated [by morgan's words about his origin] with a blow from morgan's hand [the blow is probably from tristrem to morgan, not vice versa], but he reacts promptly, while rohand arrives [was he born in an adulterous circumstance? that is what morgan accuses him of: __illegitimate child__; a detail that, in fact, could shed a new light on the problematic identity of this hero - an outcast with little virtue, and not many qualities].

990. having killed morgan, tristrem seizes the entire land [so far this narrative resembles more _horn_ and _havelok_ than _tristan_ - __exile and return__], and leaves it to rohand's control. he then decides to return to england, where mark is vexed by the __tributes__ that he owes to ireland [the poet describes this tribute in __detail__; again a great attention to __material particulars__; like in havelok and in the m. e. amiloun, the historical surface and the socioeconomic conditions that form the background of the story are emphasized]. tristrem accepts to assist him; the tribute is now __people__ - 300 noble children. the man sent to collect the tribute - unjust - is an __irish giant__.

1089. the fight against the giant is fought in "open sea," on a ship. the fight is repetitive; the giant's horse is killed - __violence and brutality__; repetition of words, assonance [the violence of the conflict is expressed through the actual reiteration of the same poetical - verbal - fragments].

1177. as he wins the battle, tristram speaks with "pride," and asks the opponent to bring him any irish - he will fight them all [he turns the fight into a war - the opposite of what mark had done for his father]; he wins, but he remains __severely wounded__; and although he is promised inheritance of the land, he has to remain in bed for three years; having lost hope in his recovery, he asks to be brought to a ship, with a harp; left by himself, he reaches the shores of dublin.

	- the poet emphasizes how the wounds __stink__ [another crucial material detail; the insistence on this sickness, for a famous lover, could be an element that chaucer had in mind while composing his _troilus_].

1287. having realized that he is in a foreign land [__ireland__], he adopts the invented name "tramtris" [the same inversion used by his father]; the queen of the land, a prodigious healer, sends him "a plaster kene | to cast the stink oway"; she then decides to meet him, and remains admired by his fairness and by the excellence of the exotic objects that he has with him [tristram is always a fascinating __stranger__]; he is richly welcomed and treated (baths, food, feasting). the poet introduces ysonde as a maiden keen on music and "romaunce to rede." they share songs [he teaches her songs; tristram is often teaching things that he has learnt as a child - hunting and singing; these are the teachings of a foreigner]; he serves the queen for a year, then he wishes to leave [he taught her __many lais__ - the connection with the circumstance in which this very poem might have been written, as a song learnt by heart, is remarkable].

1385. back in __england__, tristrem tells markes about his story, and the women there; he is thus asked to bring ysolde there [is this an __inversion__ of the tribute originally demanded by ireland?; asking for humans instead than tributes?]; the envious barons think that the mission might prevent tristrem from seizing the throne. he accepts, and returns to ireland, for a wife.

1485. notice how the characters of the irish court are unnamed. the conflict seems to have become a __diplomatic mission__; to obtain the queen, tristrem should defeat a dragon who torments the people "of develin." tristrem fights against him, in the fields outside the city; the battle is, again, repetitive and violent; tristrem prays god [hidden behind a tree; fear could be a reason for either praise or scorn].

1595. the description of the battle seems to mix the blows struck by the giant and the skinning of the animals [same phrases and vocabulary]. having won the battle, he loses the head of the beast, which ysonde receives from a false steward, while tristram is apparently dumb - the tongue of the dragon poisoned him. with a "treacle," they make him speak again; he again conceals his true identity, saying that he is a merchant; however, using a piece of his sword, that was taken from the body of the giant moraunt [the queen's brother; the irish giant that tristram killed for mark], ysolde recognizes him [another strange take on the motif of agnition, with an unusual token to prove the identity of the hero; fighting for both sides, tristram could also be identified with those characters who are divided between two different allegiances - love and history].

1694. two tristrems: tristram and tramtrist; he asks to be spared, since he is the one who spent a year with them, teaching them songs and __foreign customs__. they accept, and they entrust their daughter to him, so that she can marry king mark, and become the queen [a strange __twist__ - the relationship that they had in peace allows him to be forgiven for the murder committed in war; the whole circumstance seems a thematization of diplomacy and the alternatives to war; in general, tristrem is here more of a diplomatic intermediary - a sort of bureaucrat or clerk - than a warrior; here he resembles pandarus]. as they travel back, they drink the love potion that ysolde's mother had prepared for her and for mark; even the hero's dog licks some of the potion left in the cup. the two become lovers - "and hodain dede also" [is this gluttony? the idea is that _anyone_ can drink from the cup, even the dog; that there is nothing special in the courtly love experienced by the two characters, that it is not morally enriching, but it is actually base passion].

1790. a complication - mark and ysolde marry; he [mark] sleeps with the handmaid, then she drinks the potion again [ysolde, that is]; at that point she wishes to kill brengwain [the handmaid], because she has slept with the king before her [very intricate twist; the purpose seems again the same as before - the love potion justifies the assertion for which courtly love is simply a different name for lust, as in the manciple's tale]. bringwain explains that she has protected her by giving the queen her "clene smock" (clean shirt). these substitutions seem too abrupt to justify a parodic reading; the characters are acting like __masks__ [figurines? puppets?], shifting.

1955. ysolde realizes her mistake - misjudgement, and repents. she starts looking for the maiden who protected her [feelings are capable of changing as abruptly as the identity of these characters]. tristrem is recognized for his talent as a harpist in this __constant game of exchanges__ [one plot element that we had missed: an irish earl disguised as a minstrel kidnaps ysonde and tristrem uses his music to rescue her]. the two keep indulging in their affair in ireland, until they are _discovered_ by meriadok [a dwarf, like in the a. n.]. tristrem had been hiding the affair as a harpour and a hunter.

2178. having been informed of the affair by meriadok, king mark seeks more proof by tricking ysolde and tristrem into a confession [little psychological insight]. his plan, however, fails, and tristram is eventually trusted and made constable of the land.

2398. after a new attempt at discovering his affair, tristrem is now in wales, fighting a giant.

	- the tale has __no psychological introspection__, only the __swiftness__ of __narrative surface__.

2815. the king realizes that there is a conflict between tristram's loyalty to him and to his cause, and tristram's affair with the queen. they are exiled, and take refuge in a __wood__ [outside civilization, a recurrent space for them - and for part of the __romance tradition__]; there they live with only their dogs [the m. e. is, as usual, richly detailed in the description of their __material conditions__]; having found them by chance, the king discovers a sword between them - this would prove that there is "trewe love" between them, without sex. the pace becomes exceptionally swift; the two are forgiven, then discovered and exiled again. tristrem travels from spain to britain; there he  fights more giants, for ysonde [this is probably the second Ysonde, the continental one].

2981. this romance seems as erratic as the stereotype about them usually is [the kind of romance which tolkien condemns in the introduction to sggk]. it incorporates many diverse episodes, characters, and circumstances. having built a house for ysonde, tristram welcomes the duke ganhardin [the brother of continental ysonde], and tells him that he has no more interest in ysonde [continental ysonde]. beliagog, the giant [whom he fought in brittany], has become a sort of servant for tristram; the two go out to seek [insular] ysolde, because she is fairer than the woman with whom he sleeps now. the two - ganhardin and tristrem - become "friends"; he shows him the statues [or the images found in his house].

3080. the two friends promise that they will go to england, to have ganhardin lie with brengwain. in england, a suitor is trying to obtain ysolde's favours, in vain. tristrem sends his token ring to ysolde, through his friend.

- the poem is incomplete.
