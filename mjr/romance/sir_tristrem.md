#Sir Tristrem

##Introduction

- the origin of the story, according to this editor, is celtic. like for _floris and blancheflour_, traditional criticism has identified a common and a courtly version of the story.

- the anglo-norman tristan (of which we only possess about one sixth of the original) belongs to the courtly category (1170). the m.e. tristrem, from the late s. xiii, could also be considered as an __adaptation__ of thomas's poem [as from prof. crane says, there has been consistent debate about the sources available to the m. e. poet; he may or may not have had a ms. version available; he might have also reconstructed the original from his memory].

- the m.e. tristrem only survives in the __auchinleck ms.__, together with 17 other romances.

- the language of the poem is remarkable; it combines northern and non-northern forms; it has been debated whether the poem should be considered scottish, northern, or southern.

- the relationship between the original and the m. e. is also problematic. the editor of teams considers it a parody; others see it as a poorer translation.

- form: short lines, in a complex stanza, with only two alternating rhymes (between six and seven syllables - three feet? - and one shorter line - two syllables) [11-line stanzas, rhyming ababababcbc].

##Comment

110. the poet spoke with thomas and read in a poem about the hero of his story; he will now tell it as it was told "in toun." it is the story of a __faded era__; the story starts with a contrast between roland and morgan - an endless battle that eventually reaches the shores of england, from brittaby. there, in a turnament against his enemy, roland dies, leaving beyond a woman, blancheflour [she dies in childbirth], and a child, tristrem.

	- brittaby is the land of war; england, ruled by markes, is where the conflict finds a __peaceful resolution__. nevertheless, this resolution is __tragic__; blancheflour "hears" this news [there is, in this initial section of the poem, a strong emphasis on _rumors_ as witnesses of historical facts].

220. roland and his men are now travelling towards another land, to rescue blancheflour; the __exposition__ here is very __fragmentary__ [elliptical and repetitive, at times strangely insistent on marginal, apparently irrelevant details]. it is apparently a second telling of the same episode. roland dies again; again the news about his death reach blancheflour, who gives birth to tristrem [and dies]. it is a __puzzling repetition__ [or it may look as a repetition, even though it is not] - perhaps connected to the __oral form__ [a motif within the text and a feature of the text itself]?

341. tristram was apparently born from an adulterous affair, which roland confessed to his actual wife only while dying [again, not sure about this detail]. the exposition is again - __problematic__. the name of the protagonist is told through a a __similar inversion__ (_usteron proteron_): "tho trem bifor the trist." the child has an exceptionally strong education - and, as we learn now - roland is not dead yet; he educates him. the child wins many hawks at chess [against a number of mariners; the number and quality of the hawks is reported in detail, as is the quantity of the money waged].

	- the episode of the successful chess game seems a __sudden narrative pause__; the pace is [everywhere else] swift.

440. the mariners with whom he was playing kidnap him; but, hit by storms, they decide to leave him on a foreign shore [like horn].

	- the stanzas seem to compose a __song__; they are often __repetitive__, as if they contained __refrains__.

	- the poet keeps referring to thomas, as if he had been a __witness to the story__.

	- on the foreign shore, tristrem finds pilgrims from "yngland." he is dressed in a nice robe; strolling through a forest.

539. tristrem offers them money to be led to the king of the land in the forest outside the castle, he sees hunters and strangely dressed beasts - they are being skinned [another passage where our ]
