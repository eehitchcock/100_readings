#Havelok the Dane

##Introduction

- according to most scholars, written between 1280 and 1290. probably a reworking of anglo-norman sources (written in the mid. s. xii).

- like horn, this hero has an __extraordinary body__; this is a feature shared with both religious and folk tales.

- the political setting of the romance juxtaposes the english and the danish monarchies.

- this editor sees the notion of the __body politic__ as a way to understand the structure of the work, where the excellence of the body is mirrored in the society that it rules.

- the work seems to defend a __continuity__ between the virtue of the __individual__ and the progress of __society__ as a whole; this is a poem that easily moves among social classes, suggesting the identity between its protagonist and each one of them [better, the continuity; and rememeber the detail of the miracolous light coming from his mouth, and the mark on his shoulder - signs of an exceptional destiny, an innate predestination for power].

- like many other medieval romances, this poem too was confused with __history__.

- the very presence of a danish protagonist would suggest that the source was a __folk tale__ [a very remote oral source, perhaps connected with the dane invasions].

- the only complete ms., dated c. 1300 - 1325, comprises king horn as well. other texts in the collection are __hagiographies__ [it would be interesting to look at the connections between these two genres; but it is not what we are doing right now].

- __form__: couplets of octosyllabic lines; __dialect__ is _northern midlands_.

##Comment

26. the poet addresses "alle men," presents the topic of his poem, and asks for a "cuppe of ful god ale" as a payment for his service [addressing the audience is a trope in havelok; one might wonder if it is also a specifically m. e. trope]. __lively monologue__, in a context that seems popular (that of a tavern, like in the c. t.).

133. the glorious __past__ of england under the just rule of athelwod, an honest king, beloved by all, generous with righteous men, and strong against the wicked ones. the poet is especially eager to describe his just __punishment__ against criminals, and his generosity with the needy. as the poem starts, he is close to death, and has no heir [_political meditation from the very start; how many of these works are using a mythical, inaccessible past to meditate about the present? and for how long has this been happening, and will that keep happening (think shakespeare)?_].

225. a general assemply of the aristocracy is summoned to find a protector for the queen and the country. entrusted with this duty, godrigh swears to be loyal on the host [the eucharistic vessel; a very interesting detail for a romance abiout food, especially given the genre's obsession with the motif of substitution and equivalence - transubstantiation?]; the focus is on the __ritual__. the king concludes by inflicting beatings on himself [part of the ritual].

327. the king dies, and everybody mourns his death. the earl, godrich, reorganizes the country; he places new administrators of his power, everywhere, to protect the land; in the meanwhile, goldeboru, the princess, reaches maturity; to keep his power, the earl imprisons her.

446. the __perspective__ - the poet's eye - now moves to denmark; there we find another dying king, who leaves his son and his land to the control of godard, another earl; like in england, the heirs are imprisoned, by the character is treated as the most evil ever [symmetry and the breaking of symmetry; the motif was in _amis and amiloun_ too; two sides proceed by doing exactly the same - something breaks the pattern, the pattern is eventually restored]; compared to the english usurper, the dane earl has a wicked agenda from the very start.

565. havelok's first words in the poem are a protest for food, a cry for hunger; he asks whether there's any "korn" to make bread with. the earl's reaction is to murder his young sisters; the emphasis is on the young hero's __impotence__ [against the dark forces of history; the tradition can be traced back to boethius]. havelok asks for mercy and swears that, if his life is spared, he'll leave the country and never seek retribution; like in king horn, __pity__ [_compassion_] stops the evil earl before he can kill the child - here this is called a "miracle"; the earl then buys the favors of a fisherman named grim, who ties up and, in a sack, brings him home.

	- the poet has a preference for the __humble material world__ of these characters - here "a kevel of clotes" [used to wrap up and to gag the young prince].

649. the lady to whom havelok has been entrusted hurts his head, by accident; before grim and his wife can complete the murder, a miracle stops them - a __light__ coming from his mouth and a birthmark on his shoulder - the __signs__ of his future accomplishments [_agnition_]; there the man understands that a noble future awaits the child. they spare him and feed him with humble food.

	- the focus is on his __bodily needs__ - the ropes hurting him and an empty stomach. his signs denote greatness, both religious and secular, but his body is frail and very human - __interpretation__ [_contrast between the earthly signfier - frail, mortal, wounded and needy - and the transcendent signified - a radiant light].

785. threatened by the evil earl, the fisherman grim sells all his possessions (humble goods, mostly farm animals and cattle), to sail away. the poet insists on the contrast between the actual havelok, young and impotent, and the promise that he shows. they reach england, in a region that will be named "grimesbi." the poet describes in detail grim's activity as a __fisherman__, including all the fish (the kinds) that he catches; __lexical richness__ for animals and food [of course, gluttony].

857. havelok decides to work with grim, to help with the satisfaction of his __insatiable appetite__; he thinks, in direct speech, that "it is no shame for to swinken" ("work"). the poet then describes havelok's work as a fish-seller (again, many __material details__ - the "panier on his bac | with fish giveled als a stac"), which is interrupted by a terribkle __famine__; havelok's drive is __hunger__ - he has to leave the house to find more food for his exceptional appetite.

927. havelok leaves the land dressed with the sail of grim's ship; he is only wearing that, like a poor begger. there he starts working as a porter for the earl's food [maybe "court"?], bringing food back and forth from the cooks to the castle. he is hired by a cook; again, __detailed description__ of each activity, full of __lexical__ particulars that provide a sense of __rich realism__.

1103. a description of all that havelok would bear - he carries; he is also a perfect worker and citizen, amicable and dedicated. everybody loves him. he is extraordinarily fair, virtuous, and strong (but as a worker, not as a warrior).

	- an assembly of noblemen is gathered in lincoln, and they organize a game - throwing a stone - where havelok excels. he gains popularity, so much that the english earl decides to marry goldeboru to hum; the reason is that he considers havelok a poor "thral"; he is unaware of his origins.

	- havelok is now excelling in the __courtly values__ [as a strong competitor in these games; the frivolous mode in which his energies are spent signifies that he is now acting in a higher social sphere].

1181. the earl tries to arrange the wedding, but he find resistance on both sides; goldeboru says that she will only marry a monarch, and havelok says that he wouldn't know how to care for a wife, since he has no __goods__ to provide for her. the earl, however, threatens them with __power__ and __violence__. they agree to marry, __impotent__ against __history__.

	- the woman accepts this destiny because, perhaps "it was goddes wille | god that makes to growen the korn | formede hire wimman to be born." __providence__ is understood through this __material sign__ [_and here is the key; the thick signifier constituted by food - gluttony is the lexical richness that makes my signifier inaccessible_].

1285. deprived of the __means__ (material means) to support his wife, havelok decides to go back to grim; although the fisherman is dead, his family welcomes the newly weds; the orphans have inherited riches and goods, and they offer them, and their services [that is, their availability to become havelok's subordinates] to havelok, so that he might become their lord [the implication seems to be that havelok is qualified to become their lord because he is better than anyone else at finding food; his ability to find food justifies his social rise; archaic society, with monarchy based on a combination of material interests and divine privilege; a fiction about archaic power]. this is still not enough for goldeboru, who is soothed only when she sees the miraculous light from his mouth, and hears a prophetic voice foreseeing the crown [here is the divine element of predestination].

1385. havelok tells the dream that he had while his wife had the ominous vision; he was a __giant__ embracing the entirety of denmark from a hill placed there, and then holding england in his hand. the wife devises a plan to conquer the land back; he prays. [the extension of his body - therefore, of his bodily needs and of his ability to provide for them - as the extension of his political powers and responsibilities.]

1445. the __prayer__, which tells the story of his __banishment__ from his perspective, is followed by an offer and by __tears__; then havelok says the story again, to grim's children, emphasizing the __false oath__ of their father [grim] to the evil earl, preferrable to the mortal sin of infanticide [which he should have committed if he had been loyal to his word].

1624. we have a lacuna of about 180 ll.; supposedly the four, dressed as peddlars, meet the dane earl [a different earl; a good earl].

1713. the four heroes are disguised as peddlars, in denmark; to obtain permission to travel from town to town, with the pretext of selling their wares, havelok is trying to sell his golden ring to a dane called ubbe; ubbe, having observed havelok's __strong body__, asks him why he is not a knight [_ubbe is characterized by his strong physical attachment to both havelok and his wife; consider the section where he discovers them in bed as well_; __interpretation__; now the hero has entered a different social context, where his physical prowress is useful not for __labor__ but for fighting]. the group is invited to dine with ubbe; havelok is worried about his wife's honor [_another marker of a change in social context is this preoccupation - the context is that of courtly love now_].

1859. a sumptuous meal (__lexical richness__; different class); ubbe expresses his appreciation for goldeboru; and when the guests leave decides to give them an armed escort to lead them to a trusted watchman, bernard; but, while they are having dinner at his place, bernard is attacked by thieves. havelok __violently__ kills many of them, alone.

	- these are common criminals, not warriors; havelok's first battle is very domestic.

1919. the fight must be happening outside the house - __domestic__ by definition; as havelok is surrounded, his friends join him in the battle, having heard the sound. notice that the battle is happening with sticks and poles, not with rich weapons. they win the fight, with much __violence__.

2051. we discover that the thieves actually were ubbe's soldiers; the earl goes to ask his trusted watchman, bernard, about the happening; bernard tells him about the attack and havelok's valiant defense. it it hadn't been for him, the thieves would have taken everything - "this man of ferne londe" [the foreigner], whom bernard recommends to ubbe, telling him that he deserves a __reward__ since "wel is set the mete he etes" [strong focus on food again].

2157. havelok has been greatly wounded during the struggle; but he is healed, and offered a room and protection in ubbe's house; while havelok is sleeping there, in the adjacent room, ubbe discovers the __miracle of the light__ in havelok's mouth, and the mark on his shoulder. he summons the entire court around the bed; we have the __agnition__ - he is recognized as the future king.

2251. havelok, recognized by the earl, has to __swear fealty to every member of society__, as a knight; his oath is taken after a long __public speech__ by the earl, where he explains to the crowd summoned there that havelok is the legitimate heir. the hero and his friends all swear.

2353. the earl summons representatives from every part of the land, to witness the dubbing of havelok; it is a great celebration. we have a list of leisurely activities done by everyone; a collective feast like none of the time; the language slowly becomes that of __monarchy__ [that is, havelok is becoming a king - and being called so - after having been dubbed a knight].

2450. after having seized control of the land, havelok swears that he will get revenge against the usurper (a new oath, __unmaking__ the childhood one). [there might be two kings at this point.] they meet the earl - the evil earl - while he is hunting; the capture of the traitor is in fact transformed into a __hunt scene__, both literally and figuratively. the soldiers __flay__ and hang him, like a captured bull. he is carried on an old mare, whose "crice" [arse] covers his "nese" [nostrils - his nose is in the arse's butt]. [torture and debasement; the hunter becomes the prey, the man becomes an animal; a popular form of punishment.]

2565. havelok sets up and administers a __collective trial__ against the traitor; apparently the judgment is made by people of every class, "riche and povere, heye and lowe"; he is condemned to be __flayed alive__ - and so he is, __publicly__ and before a __collective__ clamor; after this havelok divides his property among the friends who have helped him (__legal procedure__, actual legal language). in the meanwhile, a great army is prepared in england, against him.

2635. the army is formed by summoning every capable english man (again, __collectivity__ and a sort of realism - __social realism__ _- an attention to those details of the narrative that
