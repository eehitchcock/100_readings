#Sir Gawain and the Green Knight

##Introduction

- unknown author; one single ms., containing this together with _pearl_, _patience_, and _cleanness_.

- written in a regional dialect characteristic of northern western england; probably at the end of the xiv s.; the author was probably a contemporary of chaucer.

- the language cleverly combines french courtly diction and old english vocabulary.

	- it is a language that shows the __clash__ between __two cultures__ - english and french.

	- the dialect of this area had also assimilated many danish words from the xi s. [and before that; a better word to refer to this component would perhaps be norse].

- unique __stanza form__ - __alliterative__ lines followed by a __bob and wheel__ (__rhyhming__! [the bob and wheel section, that is]).

- although the story doesn't seem to have any specific __written precedent__, its two motifs have a long history - the __beheading game__ and the __seduction__ of the hero.

	- the poet, however, adds many original details to this, and he connects them clearly.

- the __order__ of the poems in the ms. is: _pearl_, _cleanness_, _patience_, _gawain_.

	- [_brief recap: one could say that they move from the most visionary to the least visionary; from the least narrative to the most narrative; pearl is about the inaccessibility of perfection; cleanness is about the history of human sin; patience is a retelling of jonah_:

		1. pearl;
		2. cleanness;
		3. patience;
		4. gawain;]

	- there are __four illustrations__ to gawain; each one of the other poems has __2 illustrations__.

- according to davis and tolkien, the poet clearly knew the french romances very well.

##Comment

84. so far we have not encountered such a broad framing of the narrative - starting from __troy__ means, in a way, starting from the beginning of __history__ - or from the very __notion of history__. the first few lones move from this historical remoteness to the __bretayn__ of king arthur, and eventually to the eyes of "guenore." a rhetorical zooming from the __general__, the broad perspective, to the __particular__. __history__ seems to turn into __romance__.

178. the entertainment of "aventurus thing an uncouthe tale"; arthur, as we know, is "sumquat childgered," and needs to be distracted - a young, immature ruler. the atmosphere is festive; it is a celebration of prosperity, abundance, and joy (youth?). this feast is interrupted by the arrival of the green knight, an "aghlich mayster" whose rich appearance and fair figure contrast with the green of his skin, hair, clothing.

	- it is a strange and compelling problem; he is in part the perfect knight of the genre, in part a mystery [and a monster].

249. it is, for sure, one of the most detailed descriptions found in the genre; the only possible comparison could be with the pilgrims of the c. t., the greennness is not the only __exotic detail__ of his appearance; there is a sense of uncouthness, __ruggedness__, wilderness, in all his appearance; the horse shares his __exceptional beauty__, his precious ornments, and his __wild arrangment__. he carries no war gear, only the "holyn bobbe" and his "ax." __reverence__; this section keeps shifting from the eyes of the knights, looking at the green giant, to the eyes of the giant, __looking__ at them and seeking their leader [mutual _interpretation_; the foreigner is studying the court while the court looks at him].

389. arthur reveals himself, and the knight explains his peaceful intentions; he is here only to test the __valor__ - virtue - of the __worthiest men__ ever existed by playing a "crystemas gamen" with them; he explains the __rules__. no knight is brave enough to accept the challenge, so that arthur responds to it by seizing the axe; but before the game starts, gawain - who was sitting next to "the quene," interrupts them and, in a very curteous speech, asks to replace the king (__style__ - ornate and rhetorically sound, with many french terms [_as prof. crane pointed out, the accessibility of this vocabulary contrasts with the intricate syntax of this section; in the old english parts the opposite occurs - elementary syntax, very rare words_]). the court and the king accept, so that gawain walks up to the knight; the __ritual__ begins with his saying his __name__.

490. the ritual resembles a __baptism__ [or a dubbing ceremony]; the knight calls its rules a "covenaunt." gawain beheads the knight, green blood flows from his body. beheaded, and holding his head, the knight goes back to his horses and rides towards the exit. he reminds gawain of his __promise__, to be fulfilled in a year from then. he leaves; the court is left with ambivalent dread and wish to enjoy the rest of the feast.

589. __anxiety__ about the passing of time; although he is enjoying the __present__, gawain knows that this prosperity is __ephemeral__; we have a lyrical description of the passing of the seasons, haunted by the ominous deadline awaiting the hero. the __anxiety__ is shared by the entire court, but always __concealed__ under apparent joy [the clothing, the food, the feasts]. gawain prepares to leave for his quest; he wears his armor.

690. before wearing his helmet, gawain attends the mass; the poet describes in detail his head gear and his shield, where the "pentangel" shines. the poet now describes in detail the shape and significance of the "endeles knot." __interpretation__ of its five corners [_the pentangel is, apparently, a completely accessible sign_]; among tears, he leaves the court.

784. gawain travels through a specific __insular__ geographical __landscape__, with many local __toponyms__; it was probably a context well known to the poet and his audience. it is surprising, though, that the hero looks for this __supernatural__ "grene chapel" only here. apparently the poet slowly transitions to the __supernatural__ mode, introducing "ferly" enemies and "mony mervayl"; at the same time he intensifies the description of an __inhospitable natural landscape__, with exceptionally __cold weather__. it's __christmas__; he prays and repents, until he sees a __beautiful castle__.

	- the journey is therefore an intensification of: __allegorical/religious__; __marvelous/romance__; __nature__.

900. the castle is a __marvel__ - the embodiment of a __marvel__; gawain is welcomed by all its inhabitants, who show __admiration__ as they serve him. gawain admires the fairness and __authoritativeness__ of the host. he is given a rich bedroom and clothing; he wears what he wishes, to become more __attractive__. he is also served a full meal; again, comfort and prosperity.

994. gawain reveals his __name__; he is __recognized__ as a famous hero by the host and the court, who have great expectations about his stay there. we have here the two contrasting portraits of the lady of the castle and her old companion; one fair and exposed, the other ugly and __concealed__ (wrinkly); __interpretation__ is fair [like the pentangle; it is _apparently_ fair]; gawain immediately shows his admiration for the woman; after the celebration, they all go to bed.

1125. on the following day we see more __celebration__ and joy - the same found in arthur's court; food, songs, wine, dancing, and the "cortays carp" between gawain and the lady; it is a __three-days celebration__ (remember that it started on christmas). after that gawain asks the lord to tell him about the "grene chapel"; the host then explains his plan - gawain will wait for the right day __in bed__ [paralisis is always threatening the romance hero]. the imperative, in the meanwhile, is to "dowelle" [just like in langland; an explicitly moral imperative]. they also agree to play another game, "with the trowthe"; they will swap their achievements.

1207. the third fitt opens with the lords' men preparing for the hunt, at sundawn, led by the host; it is a huge, energetic hunt; the focus is on the __noise__ produced by its participants, and on the __swift__ series of actions leading to the capture. in the meanwhile gawain is awoken by a small noise, and glimpses through the bedding the arrival of the lady; he pretends to __sleep__ [if this is really a scene drawn from the tradition of the dream vision, then the feigned sleep must have a deeper significance] while she kisses him; the focus is on __sight__ and __human signs__.

1318. the first interaction between gawain and the lady; the premise is that she expects him to act according to the principles of "hendelayk," for which he is renown [therefore, not just these abstract principles of "courtesy" but also the literary tradition from which they are drawn, and to which gawain belongs]; it is a matter of __agnition__, and it uses the __trope__ of the "having heard of." they exchange a __kiss__.

1420. on the field, the hunters are processing the meat of the hunted deer. it is an act of __separation__, and the poet indulges in its description - focusing on the __cutting__ and on the __flesh__ [separation; here we have the lexical abundance of __linguistic gluttony__ and its systematic division and elimination - __analysis__; is this a depiction of the __act of interpretation__, of getting rid of the __thickest signifier__, to perceive the true meaning beyond it?]; back to the castle, they __exchange__ the prizes - the flesh for the kiss; the second day begins.

1556. the scene on the field is again one of __noise__ and __collective motion__; they are hunting one boar; in meanwhile, gawain and the lady exchange another kiss; the focus of their discussion is alwaays on the conventions of courtesy and the __customs__ of each land; the lady asks him to teach her some __words__ of love; now she is referring not only to a social, but to a __literary tradition__ (__tyxt__); the problem seems that of a __double allegiance__, to love and to the lord.

1667. the wild swine is eventually captured and killed; the prize is split among the hunters; at home they exchange prizes again - the head for two kisses - and again they renew the game on the eve of the third day. the exchange scene is prolonged, as a __feast__.

1769. the host reminds gawain that the conclusion is near; their final promise is especially __ominous__. the opening of the hunt resembles the first two, for noise and collective motion; but soon the fox is treated as an __individual sinner__, as a __thief__; in the meanwhile (the stanza-to-section correspondence is breaking), the lady, dressed in a __revealing__ fur, awakens gawain from an ominous __dream__ about his impending doom. her presence comes as a comfort; they kiss and exchange __sweet words__.

1892. the final dialogue concerns almost entirely the exchange of gifts; gawain reveals his fears about his __betrayal of the host's trust__, in conflict with his __pledge__ to __courtesy__; she obtains his benevolence, and then she asks an __exchange__ of gifts; she gives him her "kyrtel," explains its __value__ [is it a good or a bad gift? _crucial question, in fact_]; he accepts. then he goes to __confess__; we still do not know whether the kyrtel is part of his confession or not.

	- or is the kyrtel analogous to his confession, and what in truth protects him at the end?

1996. on the hunting field, the fox is captured, killed, and __skinned__. __noise and motion__; and a __hymn__ "raysed for renaude saule | with lote." all that the lord gives gawain, who awaits him in a blue robe covered in fur, is the skin of the fox, in exchange for three kisses; afterwards there is more feasting and the eventual parting of the hero and his hosts - it is the last day of the year. before going to bed - in __anxiety__ - gawain thanks all.

2090. the final fitt starts with a description of the __snowy, cold__ weather, for which gawain dresses appropriately with fur and armor; before leaving he expresses his gratitude again, and commends the castle to christ. then, guided by a local, he crosses a __steep, mysty landscape__ [emphasis on the landscape, like in the section preceding his arrival at the wonderful castle].

2188. the guide leaves gawain after having warned him about how dangerous the inhabitant of the chapel is. gawain insists that he cannot act like a coward, so that the guide gives him instructions about how to reach the place; he eventually finds it, in the form of a cave in a hill.

2283. he asks if that is the chapel, but nobody answers; he can only hear the __dreadful noise__ of a weapon being sharpened. there he finds the green knight; he shows his neck to receive the blow, but shrinks a little as the knight delivers his blow. the knight then uses - again - the language of __agnition__: "thou art not gawain." he denies.

2388. gawain denies that he will shrink again. the second blow is only feigned - witheld before hurting the knight [the executioner is now insecure, faking; reversal]. the third blow wounds gawain, but only a little. before gawain can attack the knight, this explains the meaning of the execution, based on the "treuthe" and exchange between him and the host. we now discover that the wife was sent to __tempt__ the knight; gawain feels shame.

2478. gawain has been purified, and he can keep the girdle. he confesses his remorse and goes on a __misogynistic rant__; eventually the knight __reveals__ his name and the presence of __morgan le fay__, and her plan to test gawain's virtue. they depart peacefully.

2530. back to the court of arthur, gawain feels __shame__ as he tells his story again; he __blushes__; he shows the signs of his flaws, from which he will never part. they laugh and forgive him; the last few lines seem to be referring back to the first ones, in a cycle containing __history__.
