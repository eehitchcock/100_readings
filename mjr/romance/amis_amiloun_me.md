#Amis and Amiloun

##Introduction

- the story exists in many versions; the m. e. one emphasizes its __ambiguity__.

- the stanza is formed by twelve octosyllabic lines, arranged in a __complex__ rhyming pattern (aabaabccdeed).

- the premise is that of a __pledge of friendship__, or "trewthe" [_pron. "trothe"_]; these were apparently common; this was probably one of the initial elements of the story.

- the m.e. focuses on the __vow__; other versions of the story are more __hagiographic__.

- apparently, the m. e. also emphasizes the fact that amis' choice to lie with the count's daughter was wrong; he's forced to do so, but that is a mistake.

- the text of this edition is based on the __auchinleck__ ms. - ~1330; we also have three later ms.

- the text's ambiguity in the threatment of __trewthe__ is perhaps its most studied element.

##Additional notes (from MacEdward Leach)

- leach splits the versions into two categories: the romantic and the hagiographic; according to some scholars, they have one origin, a french __chanson de geste__.

- the twelve-line tail-rhyme stanza is, apparently, "so common to romance"; it combines iambic four-stress couplets and three-stress lines. each stanza is a __narrative unit__.

- there is some occasional __alliteration__.

##Comment

60. the introduction emphasizes _duplicity_ [_twinning_]; the most repeated word is __two__; two lords, two ladies, two kids born on the same day. the poet first tells what he will tell, the many "hows" and "whats" of the story - creating a sense of __anticipation__ and a direct dialog with its public. besides, he tells us that this is a story that we can read in __other romances__. [_social context has a central role here, as we will see later_.]

	- one stanza focuses on the two names; and on the contrast between "oon" (one day, one name) and two. what is the meaning of the juxtaposition of one and two?

168. the two __wonders__ that characterize the children are their beauty and their identity - __perfection duplicated__ (how is that possible?). the form of the poem mirrors this wonder by structuring each stanza around the __identity__ or the contrast between the objects and subjects that it involves (the parents of the children, the duke addressing them, the children themselves). here both children become knights at the same time, and pledge "trewethes."

	- the narrative, therefore, is already establishing the __rules__ that will be __ethically tested__ [_rules and codes; different sets of codes; just like in sir gawain, they are declared from the beginning, but then they are contrasted and elaborated dynamically_].

276. __conflict__ is introduced; an envious steward and the death of amiloun's parents. the break is emphasized here more than it was in the a. n.; amis asks the duke whether he might leave with his friend, otherwise his heart will "breketh of thre" (three - an interesting change). the duke refuses. __asymmetrical__ events. the m. e. is also careful to set up the premise for the __agnition__; amiloun prepares the two _identical_ cups that in the a. n. appeared only at the end (same for horn's mum [_in king horn_]). [_the idea is always that of the perfect correspondence of linguistic sign and meaning, between languages but also for language itself, for the very idea of language._]

396. the two friends travel together to amiloun's home country. their parting is accompanied by a reiteration of the __pledge__, by amiloun; he forbids any "forswearing" of this bond, against god. they exchange the cups. later, at the duke's court, amis stays loyal to amiloun by denying his friendship to the steward.

	- is there a __pun__ on the meaning of _trewthe_ and _trewe_ - faithful and __true__? could this be an expansion of our idea of the romance as a meditation on __translation__? true as a correspondence between words and reality, true as a pledge?

492. the language of duplicity is now used to refer to amis and the steward; the form is following closely the increasing complexity - the breaking or falling apart - of its two heroes. in this section belisaunt, by looking at or by hearing about amis, falls in love with him. the description of this episode could be a mirror of the previous one; "hir hert brac a two." through language, the poet is describing amis' __new pledges__ in society.

588. as the lord is outside hunting, both amis and belisaunt are sick in bed; both are compelled to go out in the garden. the poet intentionally pairs them too; notice that belisaunt says that, without love, her heart might split in three (not in two) [_the system therefore is: splitting in two means love, splitting in three means separation_].

	- like the steward, the lady is asking amis for a plight of trewthe (opposed to amiloun).

696. amis' refusal mixes __religious and social (or political) regulations__ - to indulge in this sexual relationship would be sinful because the two characters belong to different ranks. the woman scorns this religious ethics, and threatens to disgrace him by feigning an attempted rape. amis thinks in silence about the __inevitable suffering__ that awaits him; the decision is to "plight" a new "trewthen" between them. _love trewthe_.

792. the evil steward notices the loving looks that the two exchange. this section of the plot is certainly more elaborate than in the a. n.; both the maid's distance and amis' resistance are __duplicated__, and the steward is described as he spies on their every move. the two eventually have sex after she promises him many riches.

876. the reaction of the duke is as suprisingly strong as in the original; but here his rage has a material manifestation - he chases amis with a sword. the outcome is almost __comedic__; amis acts undoubtedly cowardly. [_this is a beautiful poem._ _humor (comedy?) was also an important element of havelok._] to resist the king's attack, amis _lies_ openly, denying everything. [lie: not trewthe.] notice that the steward is actually protecting __truth__; it is not the typical __false murmur__ [_rumor_], prompted by envy. indeed, the fact that nobody supports amis [_in the following duel for justice, to determine who is lying_] is justified.

984. motifs found in sggk: the __delayed duel__, here scheduled for a fortnight after; the two ladies that side with amis, suggesting the __feminization__ of the hero [also, notice that they are __two__ - like the protagonists (_they are the count's daughter and her mother_)]. amis' problem is the __lie__, not the fight. he does not want to swear the false.

	- on his way to amiloun, amis kills his own horse (a detail that was not in the a. n.). the friend is immediately sought as a "gile" - a trick [_to win the duel_].

1092. in amiloun's dream the m. e. replaces the lion of the original with a "bere," and "other bestes." notice how, after they meet again, amis starts his story by blaming the steward of treason.

1188. the plot is enacted; amiloun seems to have full control of the circumstance, and he devises the exchange, instructing amis on how to __lie__ to his court and how to __lie__ by his wife (we might even infer that he is asking amis to have sex with his wife). the sword might be amis' idea [_it is; and it is apparently his only original idea; it is, perhaps, a way that the m. e. has to emphasize amis' loyalty to his friend_]; and he lies to her by using a "malady" as an excuse not to touch her body. this detail is emphasized here [_a whole dialogue; her perplexity about this sudden impotence_].

1284. the battle between amiloun and the steward, after their oath, is ferocious and bloody; the situation is solved when amiloun kills his opponent's horse.

	- the oath interrupts the preparations for the burning of the two women. before amiloun can swear, a voice warns him that an "eventour strong" will afflict him if he proceeds. the warning is extensive and explicitly religious (a voice sent from jesus). in a way, the situation mirrors the moment when amis was threatened of disgrace by the lady. __inevitable__ disgrace. amiloun chooses to protect the life of his friend, although that is sin.
