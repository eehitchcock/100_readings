##Ideas



##Introduction

- differently from _amis e amilun_, _tristran_ and _romance of horn_ are deeply connected to the __insular context__ in which they were written; they refer to the folklore, the history, and the topography of the island. in general, insular romances are less marvelous.

- the horn was written by a certain thomas - but not the one who wrote tristran.

- the line is the traditional __alexandrine of french epic__; it is divided in __laisses__.

- written around 1170 by a clerk.

- the story was probably __native__ to britain; its names are __scandinavian__.

	- as in the _m. e. horn_, we have raiders from africa that could stand for vikings.

- according to the editor, the horn marks the transition from the __chanson de geste__ to the __romance__; one element is the coexistence of both __epic__ and __courtly__ moments (love).

- we do not know the __actual sources__ of the story, although the author mentions some __written__ ones. some characters are drawm from the history of the __crusades__.

- the poem survives in three manuscripts in length, and in two more in fragments.

- the translator [_j. weiss_] has normalized the way in which the poem shifts from past to present.

##Comment

70. as the story opens, we find horn surrounded by both his allies and his enemies; __arabs__, descended from cain, and children. this section has some affinities with the m. e.; horn is beautiful and extraordinarily well educated, so much that he gains the spontaneous pity of his enemies. under suggestion of one of the king's counselors, horn and his friend are placed on a boat. the poet insists on the fact that __god__ defends his beloved ones; __providence__.

175. for thomas the parallel is obvious; god will protect horn in the same way that he protects christianity [_is this the actual reason for this elaborate intrusion of a religious conflict within this insular romance? to maintain the parallel between its hero and christianity as a whole?_]. the ship is the usual embodiment of __fortune__. the land where the children end up is brittany. again horn's beauty and education distinguishes him from his friends, and allows him to be treated well. __agnition__.

261. horn explains his lineage to the king of brittany, hunlaf. apparently these stories are shared.

368. the story is told in its entirety; how the land was attacked by __muslim raiders__, how only the children in the beach were spared. the king decides to adopt them - one for each nobleman of his court. __collective adoption__ [_again, think about language_]; horn shares his stepfather with haderof.

537. the story follows the m. e. equivalent closely. horn grows well educated and beautiful; the king's daughter falls in love with him - by listening to stories about him - and decides to meet him; she calls for the seneschal in order to speak with horn privately.

	- it is an actual __strategy__, at least apparently, and it involves every character - the princess, the maid, and herland himself. __substitution__ seems to be a principle here.

698. she seduces the seneschal in order to attain a meeting with the boy. then, in a second __substitution__, the seneschal decides to bring her haderof, and not horn. he deceives her.

	- the reason is his __loyalty__ to the king, another familiar motive (in horn too).

913. rigmel is painfully in love with horn, without having seen him. her maid has a prophetic dream about them together. her __desire__ is irresistible and even sorrowful, although she still hasn't seen horn's supernatural beauty, the one that drives women mad. the substitution is discovered, and rigmel threatens the seneschal. this agrees to bring the real horn.

1016. one way to __intepret___ the motive of the love spread through the news of someone's beauty is to identify the listener _within_ the story with the listener _of_ the story: desire is thus shaped similarly and for both sides. here desire felt by women is extremely __violent__ - the princess' servant uses the word "rape" [_as the object of her desire_]. every woman wishes to have horn "under the ermine," in their bed, as an object.

1242. the meeting. horn humbly refuses the princess' offer of love, because he feels not worthy of it. he will accept only after having tried his valor on the battlefield.

1347. the __romance__ and the __epic__ are well integrated [_love and society; heterosexual love and the functioning of politics and history_]; the queen's request for war - a war where horn could test his strength - is fulfilled by a muslim invasion; they threaten the land, and they ask inhabitants and rulers to convert, and to pay a tribute.

1593. horn is armed and prepared sumptuously for the battle. in his first struggle he kills the attackers' messengers, and becomes constable. he __proves__ his worth; he proves that he is who they believe he is. he is not an orphan, but a nobleman.

	- a __fantasy__ of virtue from noble deeds; of __aristocratic blood__ granting good qualities.

1750. horn fights vehemently, and the battle is violent and effective. the knight becomes the ruler of the land, and now decides to lead the army towards anjou, to avenge the king against its king [_probably count, or ruler_].

	- the fantasy of those african attackers is problematic; is it simply a way to depict war without referring to any of the peoples now living on the island? is it a __nationalistic fantasy__, for a united britain? there is a special vehemence - __intolerance__ - against religious difference.

2135. betrayed by one of the men accompanying him, and refusing to swear that he is unjustly accused of - because it would be an oath - horn is banished by the king's grace, and leaves the country, headed towards ireland. he would only prove his - and the princess' - honesty in __battle__.

2470. horn in ireland changes his name; the motive is the same - he wants to prove his worth from __nothing__ - as if he had __no origin__, as if he could __make__ his origin through his valor (the opening of the entire poem, ex abrupto, participates [_contributes_] to this feeling). horn lies about his identity and his lineage, with everybody in ireland. the model of brittany is followed closely: a king's daughter falls in love with him, and he tells her to wait until he's proven worthy.

2904. the irish live in peace; all that gudmod can do is excel at peaceful competiions. there is a constant emphasis on the __strangeness__ of this land and its customs; horn was not raised in the same way. in this section he listens to a lay sung about himself, and rigmel's love for him, accompanied by the harp. [_then he plays the harp himself, and completes the story._] thus, by playing this lay, he is recognized.

	- horn truly wishes the truce to be broken; he wants to fight in a war, not peace.

3252. a new arab invasion; the first section is again devoted to the messengers (or translators) sent to dublin to ask for conversion and a tribute. as horn is fighting him [_them? the messengers_], we find the motive of the ring that reminds him of his christian duties (the ring of rigmel, of __constancy__, of __identity__). again, he leads an army to repel the muslim attackers.

3566. the battle is bloody - the poet occasionally shows it from the __perspective of the enemy__, reminding their home countries, their families, their faith. horn uses a trick to drown them [_as they go towards their ships_].

3612. after the death of the two princes, the king's plan is to reward gudmod by giving him the princess and his reign as inheritance. [_we find out in a prolexis that_] this will not happen; the poet talks of __fatum__ [_that is, about the fact that we do not know the ways in which god will arrange our future, dispose his providence_].

3944. __agnition__. a pilgrim visiting the court is revealed as the son of the seneschal who raised horn in brittany; horm momentarily __denies his identity__ [_this is a puzzling moment; horn really seems eager to lie about himself_]. but eventually admits the truth, since his people are in danger. he decides to travel back to brittany, and get __revenge__.

4081. at the beginning horn simply spies the preparation for the wedding between rigmel and the king of fenenie; he is disguised as a good traveler, and he is not recognized. (__agnition and interpretation__; decyphering the __foreign presence__ - focus on __translators and disguises__.) horn lies again.

4445. the cardinal agnition; the most moving one. horn speaks to rigmel and wishes to be recognized by her. here he uses a __pun__ to refer to his name [_horn and the english word for the horn used to pour libations_], then a __pawn__ (token) of love (the ring), then a __simile__ - with a goshawk; and thus he is recognized. __a test__.

	- the test is also for her __virtue__. will she stop to speak to a poor man? will she want an __outcast__?

4581. the tournament organized to test the two contenders to rigmel's love quickly becomes a real battle, and then a siege against wikele the traitor. but a peaceful solution is found before the actual bloodshed starts, and justice and celebration ensues without violence [_this probably proves that horn has matured from his belligerent youth_].

4847. in the final section of the poem, horn returns to suddene to fight the muslim invader. now horn is the __hostile stranger__, arriving to the shores of his own land; the moorish king, rodmund, has a dream that foresees his threatening coming. the section is told entirely from the __perspective of the enemy__. we are also reminded that horn is now killing the same man who saved him. the battle becomes a crusade; and horns wins it.

4957. a small episode before the conclusion; horn meets his mother, who lived hidden in a cave.

5240. the conclusion describes the death of wikkele and the rescue of rigmel, kidnapped by him.

- __form__: rhyming alexandrines, with a strong caesura; this is the laisse of the chanson [_except for the fact that laisses were alliterative; this uses rhyme to hold together the different narrative sections - each laisse has one single rhyme_].
