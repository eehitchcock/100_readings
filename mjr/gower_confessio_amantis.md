#Confessio amantis by John Gower

##Introduction

- the confessio amantis is a __bilingual poem__ (latin and middle english) in eight books, plus a prologue. "the confessio, like many other late fourteenth century poems, creates a fiction of __soul-searching__" (through __tales in a frame__).

- the editor of this edition - russel peck - keeps comparing gower to chaucer's pardoner.

- the other work by gower that is mentioned here is _vox clamantis_, from 1378-82.

- the confession was written between 1386 and 1390; it is a development of similar ideas.

- the frame of the stories told is a debate between __allegorical personifications of the soul__ [_these are the three levels of this pedagogical treatise, corresponding to the three genres; the level of a confession of the self, corresponding to the penitential manual; the level of an interpersonal love relationship, corresponding to the boethian dialogue about love, and the level of the social meditation on government and history, corresponding to the mirror of princes genre; three levels of analysis, from the individual to the community, and three corresponding genres._]

	- the story of the book stands for the experience of the book - the act of reading its tales.

- this useful introduction contains a brief history of _ymaginatyf_ as one of the brain's faculties. it was - apparently - introduced to the english letters in the later fourteenth century, and it was very influential on gower (and langland!) [_here it corresponds to the character of genius, the confessor and teller of tales_].

- among the personifications, genius has a paramount role. he is drawn from the __visionary tradition__, and he has as direct antecedents _roman de la rose_ and _de planctu naturae_. he might be connected to the very idea of imaginative.

- the editor creates a special genre for gower's tradition, from boethius, to langland, to usk, to this: that of __consolation__. it is a __pedagogy__ - a __pilgrimage__.

- we have about fifty manuscripts of confessio amantis.

##Prologue

92. the concern is immediately that of __writing__ and the ways in which this activity can affect society and history. an english project worth of its latin predecessors. the author insists on "this bok" and its regal readers [_it is a book for the prince; this is the political anxiety that i should be focusing on anyway, the true latent project of the confessio_].

192. the prologue describes the decadence of the __present times__, when society is in constant conflict and peace cannot be successfully preserved. it is a social world which does not mirror its higher models adequately - divinity and love. love is now lost, and the preponderance of __individual interests__ creates poverty and conflict.

	- the idea is that of a __transcendent model__ that should shape the material world.

	- the form alternates latin verses with english _octosyllabic lines_ (short lines, in couplets). the juxtaposition is systematic, like the prosimetrum of __b__.

297. here the contrast between __antiquity__ and the __present__ is based on the contrast between old and new christianity. in recent times the church has become covetous - simony is its greatest sin. christ has been forgotten.

	- the central idea is that of __memory__ - __history is a model__ in the same way as divinity.

437. the poem incorporates many images to discuss or to describe the same idea - here the corruption of the clergy and the decadence of christianity. gower uses, for instance, a parable about sheep and their shepherd. __social poetry__
