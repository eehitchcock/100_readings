|Compilation; Scribes; Trade|Bahr analyzes the interaction between book production and literary forms; he claims that the third booklet of Auchinleck is an autonomous piece, which exemplifies its __mercantile__ destination.|

- The focus of booklet three would be "imitative social aspiration."

- It is a book about the __interpretation of phyisical manuscripts__ and __literary forms__, and their recurring __overlaps__; material text and immaterial work were nto two distinct entities in the m.a.; it is a work of reconciliation between materialism and formalism.

	- __Compilation__ occurs at the intersection between __manuscript__ and __form__ (ordinatio as well); bahr also explores the claim for which the very canterbury tales would be a __compilatio__.
