#Kerby-Fulton, Hilmo, Olson: Opening Up Middle English Manuscripts

##Preface and introduction

- the author starts by discussing the seminal article by doyle and parkes on "the production of copies of tct and the ca in the early fifteenth century" - 1978; the article proved that three of the five scribes who worked on the "__trinity gower__" had previously copied important editions of chaucer and langland; a previously unknown __network of literary connections__ had become visible; the book intends to make these sorts of discourses comprehensible to a wider audience of scholars.

	- the authors regard ms studies as a __multidisciplinary field__, of which paleography is only __one side__.

	- the introduction presents ten plates in chronological order, to provide a quick overview of changes in scripts: from __gothic textura__ to __anglicana__, to __secretary__ and __cursive__.

##1. Major Middle English Poets and Manuscript Studies, 1300-1450

- the chapter focuses on literary centers outside of london first - __arundel 292__, a bestiary; __harley 2253__, a perfect example of a __trilingual literary culture__; the __gawain__ manuscript, a perfect link between the early and later production of xiv s.

	- with the emergence of london we identify the __three scribes__ first described in doyle and parkes' piece - __B (possibly pinkhurst)__, who copied both the __hengwrt__ and the __ellesmere__ chaucer, as well as the main ms for __piers b-text__; __d__, another scribe for the c.t. and langland and __many copies__ of the confessio amantis, and whose name might have been "john marchaunt," a common clerk, and __e__ - __thomas hoccleve__ himself.

	- studying these ms. allows us to discover more about authorial practices and contexts.

1. _Ms Arundel 292, Archaism, and the Preservation of Alliterative Poetry c. 1300 - c. 1450_

	- arundel 292, copied around 1300, is the starting point of this investigation; it is a __collection__ of __alliterative middle english works__; the oldest and first is a __bestiary__; follows a mid-1300 poem about "choristes" and a lively one on "blacksmiths"; all these were composed in __east anglia__; all these were added to a __latin collection__ of religious texts (_multilingualism_; the blacksmiths were added facing the furnaces of purgatory, _that is, the furnaces of hell, evoked by a work on purgatory_); the three alliterative poems are a document of the __alliterative revival__ beginning elsewhere [east anglia, not the west midlands of langland], and __earlier__, in england; copied with __anglo-saxon__ characters in a __multilingual__ setting (latin and french), and possibly an inspiration for langland himself, from a liturgical context (that is, this sort of book, with its combination of sacred latin song, english alliterative verse, holy and secular, political especially, concerns).

2. _Harley 2253 and the principles of compilatio, or: why read the harley lyrics in their natural habitat?_

	- the harley 2253 is a treasure; it contains many unique copies of important m. e. lyrics written before 1349; among these we find a number of __alliterative poems__, none of which is secular (_this is possibly sacred_; like their descendants, they are political or satirical in tone); they anticipate all the major ricardian poets in content and form.

	- the poems were transcirbed in the most important vernacular book-producing area of the time - the __south-west midlands__.

	- the hand of harley 2253 was both a __scribe__ and a __compiler__; the book is exemplary for its __ordinatio__ and __copmpilatio__ - playful in its juxtaposition of __languages__ and __topics__ (facing pages have two poems about the same event, one in m.e., the other in a.n. - with opposite historical perspectives), and careful in its __editing__ and __collecting__ heterogeneous texts (__wide range of dialects__, _another form of multilingualism?_).

	- the most striking technique used by the compiler is "__mirroring__," a technique inherited from the tradition of __contrafacta__ (lyrics that maintained the same opening of __popular models__, and then changed the content - maintaining __line and rythm__, but altering the purpose radically, from __secular to religious__; _these are popular collaborative writing practices, which slowly develop into genres_), created during __poetic competitions__ originated in __france__, and called __puy__. [this was a __prolific scribe__, his script was __anglicana__, which he used for charters and legald douments; he might have died in the plague of 1349].

	- the three most striking features of harley 2253 are the __geographical range__ of its __dialects__; its __thematic clusters__; its __linguistic democracy__ (english especially, paired with __latin__ and __a.n.__). 

	- poetry in english was a __rare interest__ at the time; working mainly with legal __latin__ and __french__, the harley compiler was probably an __aficionado__ of the __nascent literary form__ [this is incredibly important for discussions of multilingualism and the _voraciousness_ of the english language]; english is at times __part of multilingual poems__.

	- the __juxtaposition__ and __rubrication__ of poems was also __strategic__ and __political__ - a poem about "_in the ecclesiastical court_," documenting the __corruption and sadism__ of __clergy__ and the "__maltreatment__" of the working poor, is placed alongside __matthew's parable on social justice__ - labourers in the vineyard [another very important notion; the book is omnivourous, and its assimilation strategies have political implications].

	- some poems, like the anglo-norman "_gilote and johanne_," are written for __multiple voices__, with indications for the __different speakers__ (initials on the margin); others, like the __bob-an-wheel__ poem "the follies of fashion" (partly alliterative), are arranged to emphasize the __floating character__ of some lines (the four-lines stanzas are bracketed, with the bob somehow linked to all of them).

3. _Gawain and the medieval reader: the importance of manuscript ordinatio in a poem we think we know_

	- kerby fulton analyzes cotton nero a. x. art. 3 - the gawain ms. (pearl, cleanness, patience, and sggk); all __alliterative poems__.

	- she calls the hand of cnax3 "__strange__"; it is a form of __gothic textualis rotunda media__, a script that belongs to the __xiii__ s. (not the second half of s. __xiv__), used for copies of __owl and the nightingale__ and other __foundational works__ of english literature; the transcription also displays a __significant anglo-norman__ influence (due, probably, to either the impact of __a.n. romances__ on the poem, or - more likely - to the familiarity that the scribe had with __anglo-norman__ bureaucracy, like __harley__); the scribe was therefore trying to __imitate an ancient english tradition__.

	- the owner of the manuscript, its copists, and its author, were connected to an __educated__, influential upper class located around cheshire.

	- the first element of ordinatio emphasized by kf is the presence of __initials__ to organize the poem and to stress the importance of some sections (the __hunt scenes__, the moments of "__soul searching__"); the fitts are a victorian addition, while the original text is split into __nine passages__.

	- the treatment of rhyme changed importantly over the xiv s.; the scribe of sggk, however, makes several __archaic choices__; he places the __bob line__ to the right of the stanza, often two or three lines before the last one (ex., the "wyth wynne" of the first stanza brackets lines referring to __britain, rome and lombardy__), referring to multiple lines at once.

	- the same floating bob is found in the __hengwrt__ "_thopas_."

##3. Madie Hilmo, The Power of Images in the Auchinleck, Vernon, Pearl, and two Piers Plowman MSS.

4. _The Pearl Manuscript_

	- hilmo starts by addressing the __apparent crudeness__ of the images found in cotton nero ax.

	- she notices that, although the __theme__ of at least three out of four of these poems is religious, the illuminations contain no depiction of god or the virgin; the __reticence__ probably indicates that the book was produced when the value of images had already been questioned by lollards.

	- the illuminations seem to emphasize the __moral trajectory__ of the protagonists of each poem.

	- the illustrations seem to have been __added to the text__ (perhaps after the work on the __trascription__ had been completed); four precede pearl, five fill the blank pages between the poems, three appear at the end, after _sggk_.

	- the balance in the arrangement of the miniatures suggests that the artist planned them as a __whole__; as hilmo explains, his intention might have been to create "an overarching spiritual narrative"; the narrative depicts a character __mourning the loss__ of a beloved one, then trying to access a castellated fortress (pearl); then a series of episodes from the old testament (cleanness, patience); finally the entrance to camelot, identified, potentially, with the __celestial jerusalem__ (_sggk_).

	- the first image, with the voice of pearl depicted as a __dreamer__ asleep in a garde, seems to borrow from similar __christian iconography__ (adam, st. augustine; and perhaps even endymion; _a note: it is interesting to compare the images chosen for pearl, where the character is mostly acting, with those chosen for cleanness, patience, or, in part, gawain, where the characters portrayed are speakers, like in the douce plowman tradition;_); next to the dreamer, according to hilmo, we see a spot that is as __polysemous__ as the one in the poem (it really looks like a stream); hilmo explains that underneath the darker point we find __traces__ of flowers and grass, details not visible where the artist was more explicitly trying to recreate water; the painter is clearly less careful when it comes to coloring.

	- hilmo notices the consistency of space in the illuminations.

	- the depictions of the dreamer in the garden mirror closely the traditional representations of __god during creation__ (this might explain the occasional __erasures__).

	- finally, hilmo briefly describes the __extravagant hat__ worn by the dreamer in the first image, then lost; she suggests that it might represent his spirit, "taking flight."

	- the woman encountered by the dreamer wears a __crown__ and a collar with three pearls (pearl and __trinity__); in the last picture, she becomes almost one with the __walls__ of the __celestial city__ (for hilmo she stands for the "pearl gate" of john's revelation); the cycle of pictures ends here - leaving the dreamer in this __suspended state of desire__.

	- there are apparently no images in cleanness worth discussing, so that hilmo moves to _patience_, whose first image, jonah thrown into a whale (being eaten by it), is placed right at the end of the cleanness poem; this is immediately followed by an image of jonah __preaching__ [again, the juxtaposition of characters acting - perhaps enduring - and characters speaking].

	- for hilmo these images are incredibly dense with __biblical references__, which multiply the actual referents of each sign indefinitely, creating __typological and allegorical__ echoes.

	- for hilmo, the whale stands for __death__ (like the stream in the pearl sequence).

	- the images are undoubtedly __painted after__ the completion of the ms. (although they might have been drawn at the same time).
	
	- for hilmo, jonah __preaching__ follows the tradition of __jesus preaching after the harrowing of hell__ (she finds a number of iconographic similarities, such as the proportions between the different characters); next to the crowd being preached to, we find a man dressed like the dreamer in pearl (same __extravagant hat__, same gown); possibly a self-portrait, or a depiction of the poet?

	- the four images of _sggk_ depict the giant at arthur's court; gawain at the castle of bertilak, seduced by the queen; gawain at the green chapel, and - again - gawain in camelot, praised by arthur and the knights.

	- the image of gawain at camelot with the giant is, for hilmo, remarkable for the __many blades__ displayed in it; these may represent the ritualistic aspect of the episode, matching sacrifice or circumcision; it also echoes the beheading of john the baptist.

	- interestingly, the image of gawain at the green chapel perfectly __mirrors__ the first one - gawain as the rider/intruder, the giant as the axe-wielding protector of the household.

	- hilmo then describes the hellish landscape of the chapel, where we see a __daunting cave__.

	- the final miniature shows a __reconciliation__ between gawain and the court, under an arc that may represent an __access__ [to a sort of transcendent truth].

##4. Kerby-Fulton: Professional Readers at Work; Annotators, Editors, and Correctors

- the chapter examines __annotation__, both anonymous and authorial.

	- late middle english author probably envisioned a __system of annotations__ for their works; at times, imitating the pre-humanist modes of dante, petrarca, boccaccio, they even wrote these themselves (gower and latin in the __confessio amantis__).

	- it is debated whether chaucer himself planned a similar commentary for the canterbury tales.

	- annotations had __different purposes__ for different texts and genres.

	- books soon developed elaorate systems of __ordinatio__ for notes.

1. _Categories of marginalia: the annotating and glossing of chaucer_

	- kerby-fulton distinguishes between __four types of marginalia__: ethical pointers; narrative reading aids; polemical responses; literary responses.

	- the work on chaucer's canterbury tales is fascinating; we learn about reader expectations and frequent mistaken inferences; they were, at times, as puzzled as contemporary readers (they often sought __historical referents__ to vague allusions made by the poets).

	- some of these __lexical or grammatical glosses__ (helpful to understand middle english) were added by the very scribe responsible for the main text; at times, as in ellesmere 7.3050, the annotation identifies, with "__auctor__," the actual __authorial voice__ [but doesn't the doubt remain? couldn't this be the auctor of the tale, rather than chaucer himself?].

	- ethical pointers either __instruct__ (command, morally) or __reveal__ truths (theological ones).

	- annotators often had __graphical systems__ to distinguish between different kinds of annotations; in hengwrt, pinkhurst marked __every narrative reading aid__ with two parallel slashes.

	- __glosses__, a subset of annotations, were closely related to the idea of __interlingual translation__ [the same discussed by copeland].

	- __vernacular texts__ often interacted with __latin glosses__, and often with problematic results; the ellesmere glossator, for instance, adds a story of uxoricide next to the wife of bath's description of her fourth husband [the ellesmere chaucer is an "authorizing" manuscript; how does this engender the ideal recipient?]; his use of a __sober latin reference__ contrast the heated tone of the wife, almost identifying the boundary between languages with that between genders.

	- glosses are most often composed by authors themselves, while annotations are offered by scribes; there are __significant exceptions__; differences between __authorial glosses__ and __scribal annotations__ allow us to understand the corresponding gap between __expected public__ (in the author's intentions) and the actual __audience__.

	- most of the glosses to chaucer's tales are in __latin__; many of these connect the tales of the marriage group to the __humanist and classical__ sources; here the most heavily glossed portion are the debates or polemical sections; __debates and polemical arguments__, given their extensive use of __soruces__, often require __erudite explanations__.

	- but at times these glosses do more than simply providing __background__; they __authorize__ the debates, they __ambiguate__ them, and at times potentially __heighten__ their irony; they were added very early in the history of the text - perhaps by chaucer himself (this is kf's argument).

	- the __same set of glosses__ accompanies the wife of bath's prologue in __ellesmere__ and in __hengwrt__; it was transcribed by pinkhurst in both cases, although those for hengwrt were probably not planned from the beginning, so that they are cramped in the right margin; while the layout of ellesmere was designed to __host__ the glosses.

	- __ellesmere__ contains the __best apparatus of glosses__; it is both possibly authorial and thoroughly planned; in the case of the wife of bath's prologue, the glosses constantly refer to the __biblical quotes__ contained in jerome's mysoginist work, the "__adversus jovianum__"; they refer to many of the antimatrimonial texts explicitly mentioned by the poem, but also to many __obscure works__ possibly known only to __chaucer__ [that is, the scribe was either directly instructed by him, or had access to his own documents].

	- the persistent references to jerome in fact undermine some of the wife's arguments (e.g., her use of "__crescite et multiplicamini__," already countered by jerome's text); the whole prologue becomes, in fact, an __extended gloss to jerome's argument__ [chaucer's tale as a gloss].

	- kf analyzes the glosses to the passage about the "diffinicioun" of the __number of spouses__ allowed by the scripture; here the glosses expand an __articulate and ambivalent textual universe__, accessible in different ways by different kinds (tiers) of readers, depending on their degree of latin literacy and knowledge of the sources.

	- similarly, the passage on the wife having "__power__" over her husband's "body" is supported by four quotations from jerome, and closely matched by one from paul; but this last one is essentially a __misquotation__, where the context, omitted here, would radically alter the meaning of the words cited; overall, the glosses work like those in __langland__ (_by glosses kf means_ the latin lines); kf [claims] that gower's glosses in _confessio amantis_ are different, since they either __support__ or __overtly displace__ the context of the main text (chaucer's glosses are __oblique__); both authors understand that texts were often read from gloss to main text (__inwards__, from apparatus to primary source), maintaining a strict left-to-right, latin-to-vernacular progression; chaucer and gower deployed this implicit hierarchy in opposite ways.

	- kf concludes by analyzing an editorial mystery; the glosses to ellesmere and hengwrt were transcribed by the same person, pinkhurst; but at times they __do not match__; for instance, hengwrt has a set of glosses connecting the miracle of the prioress's tale to john of garland's miracula beatae virginis, a version of the story with a happy and less antisemitic conclusion; for kf, this might have been part of a project for an __alternative ending__, later discarded.
