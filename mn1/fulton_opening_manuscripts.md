#Kerby-Fulton, Hilmo, Olson: Opening Up Middle English Manuscripts

##Preface and introduction

- the author starts by discussing the seminal article by doyle and parkes on "the production of copies of tct and the ca in the early fifteenth century" - 1978; the article proved that three of the five scribes who worked on the "__trinity gower__" had previously copied important editions of chaucer and langland; a previously unknown __network of literary connections__ had become visible; the book intends to make these sorts of discourses comprehensible to a wider audience of scholars.

	- the authors regard ms studies as a __multidisciplinary field__, of which paleography is only __one side__.

	- the introduction presents ten plates in chronological order, to provide a quick overview of changes in scripts: from __gothic textura__ to __anglicana__, to __secretary__ and __cursive__.

##1. Major Middle English Poets and Manuscript Studies, 1300-1450

- the chapter focuses on literary centers outside of london first - __arundel 292__, a bestiary; __harley 2253__, a perfect example of a __trilingual literary culture__; the __gawain__ manuscript, a perfect link between the early and later production of xiv s.

	- with the emergence of london we identify the __three scribes__ first described in doyle and parkes' piece - __B (possibly pinkhurst)__, who copied both the __hengwrt__ and the __ellesmere__ chaucer, as well as the main ms for __piers b-text__; __d__, another scribe for the c.t. and langland and __many copies__ of the confessio amantis, and whose name might have been "john marchaunt," a common clerk, and __e__ - __thomas hoccleve__ himself.

	- studying these ms. allows us to discover more about authorial practices and contexts.

1. _Ms Arundel 292, Archaism, and the Preservation of Alliterative Poetry c. 1300 - c. 1450_

	- arundel 292, copied around 1300, is the starting point of this investigation; it is a __collection__ of __alliterative middle english works__; the oldest and first is a __bestiary__; follows a mid-1300 poem about "choristes" and a lively one on "blacksmiths"; all these were composed in __east anglia__; all these were added to a __latin collection__ of religious texts (_multilingualism_; the blacksmiths were added facing the furnaces of purgatory, _that is, the furnaces of hell, evoked by a work on purgatory_); the three alliterative poems are a document of the __alliterative revival__ beginning elsewhere [east anglia, not the west midlands of langland], and __earlier__, in england; copied with __anglo-saxon__ characters in a __multilingual__ setting (latin and french), and possibly an inspiration for langland himself, from a liturgical context (that is, this sort of book, with its combination of sacred latin song, english alliterative verse, holy and secular, political especially, concerns).

2. _Harley 2253 and the principles of compilatio, or: why read the harley lyrics in their natural habitat?_

	- the harley 2253 is a treasure; it contains many unique copies of important m. e. lyrics written before 1349; among these we find a number of __alliterative poems__, none of which is secular (_this is possibly sacred_; like their descendants, they are political or satirical in tone); they anticipate all the major ricardian poets in content and form.

	- the poems were transcirbed in the most important vernacular book-producing area of the time - the __south-west midlands__.

	- the hand of harley 2253 was both a __scribe__ and a __compiler__; the book is exemplary for its __ordinatio__ and __copmpilatio__ - playful in its juxtaposition of __languages__ and __topics__ (facing pages have two poems about the same event, one in m.e., the other in a.n. - with opposite historical perspectives), and careful in its __editing__ and __collecting__ heterogeneous texts (__wide range of dialects__, _another form of multilingualism?_).

	- the most striking technique used by the compiler is "__mirroring__," a technique inherited from the tradition of __contrafacta__ (lyrics that maintained the same opening of __popular models__, and then changed the content - maintaining __line and rythm__, but altering the purpose radically, from __secular to religious__; _these are popular collaborative writing practices, which slowly develop into genres_), created during __poetic competitions__ originated in __france__, and called __puy__. [this was a __prolific scribe__, his script was __anglicana__, which he used for charters and legald douments; he might have died in the plague of 1349].

	- the three most striking features of harley 2253 are the __geographical range__ of its __dialects__; its __thematic clusters__; its __linguistic democracy__ (english especially, paired with __latin__ and __a.n.__). 

	- poetry in english was a __rare interest__ at the time; working mainly with legal __latin__ and __french__, the harley compiler was probably an __aficionado__ of the __nascent literary form__ [this is incredibly important for discussions of multilingualism and the _voraciousness_ of the english language]; english is at times __part of multilingual poems__.

	- the __juxtaposition__ and __rubrication__ of poems was also __strategic__ and __political__ - a poem about "_in the ecclesiastical court_," documenting the __corruption and sadism__ of __clergy__ and the "__maltreatment__" of the working poor, is placed alongside __matthew's parable on social justice__ - labourers in the vineyard [another very important notion; the book is omnivourous, and its assimilation strategies have political implications].

	- some poems, like the anglo-norman "_gilote and johanne_," are written for __multiple voices__, with indications for the __different speakers__ (initials on the margin); others, like the __bob-an-wheel__ poem "the follies of fashion" (partly alliterative), are arranged to emphasize the __floating character__ of some lines (the four-lines stanzas are bracketed, with the bob somehow linked to all of them).
