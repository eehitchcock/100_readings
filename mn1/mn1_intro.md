Notions about the Minor List #1 - Rhetorical and Scribal Transitions

- - -

- The Auchinleck manuscript : National Library of Scotland, Advocates' MS.19.2.1 ; with an introd. by Derek Pearsall & I. C. Cunningham


##Notes

- A book like _Pause and Effect_ embodies the purpose of this work perfectly; it is a historical exploration of formal aspects that can be easily traced; it considers the interaction between material history (the book, the scribe), linguistic or rhetorical history (grammar, punctuation), and literary history (the genre). They all interact to form a whole; they can all be considered as a whole.

- Buchthal's _Historia Troiana_ is a book about two manuscripts of Guido delle Colonne; this could be read side by side the text itself. It is a fascinating insight into the practice of illustration.

Then we have:

	- _Opening up the Medieval Book_ is an extensive survey

	- _Medieval Reading_ is all about Latin Grammar; perhaps useless here.

In this list we should include:

	- _The Idea of the Vernacular_
