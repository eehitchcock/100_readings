#BL Add. MS 47682: Holkham Bible Picture Book

- Question: could this be the work of an __artist scribe__? [That is, how do we ascertain the chronology of the conception and production of this volume? Images were clearly prepared before the introduction of writing, and there is an undeniable synergy between them and the text; but there are also many overlaps, omissions, sites of misunderstanding.]

- Consider the orientation of __gaze__ [some characters stare at the readers, while others seem only concerned with their surrounding; and the choice seems particularly deliberate - only the holiest among these characters are capable of piercing beyond the margin of the page].

- is the creator of f. 3 [that is, god creator] identified [or identifiable] with the scribe and patron of f. 1 [the opening image depicts the scribe and the patron, emphasizing the centrality of writing and textuality that will be a constant throughout the cycle; the anthropomorphized god that walks through his creation might constitute a parallel with him].

- the __wheel of fortune__ is a sequence of __latin verbs__, apparently in different tenses [this emphasizes both the role of textuality and the possible pedagogical function of the manuscript itself].

- the creator holds a __compass__ - the same compass used to draw the circle in which he's been inscribed [by the miniaturist; still, this is a very conventional image in the iconography of creation]; on f. 4 we see ada, and eve working after the expulsion from paradise - __herding goats__, spinning their wool [not only we find an emphasis on manual labor, but also an awareness of the role of each task - a sequence of labor that becomes a history of labor]
