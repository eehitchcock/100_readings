- a large volume; a rich ms., gold is used for the background of the frequent miniatures; together with the litterae notabiliores, the miniatures seem a feature of ordinatio, useful to identify distinct moments of the narrative (rubrics witht e "comment" of headers often precede the images).

	- the miniatures seem to show little variation, mostly portraying two characters involved in conversation.

	- the annotations might be an interesting feature - we have the shortened "notae," the pointing fingers, some later rubrications, some decorations added to the elongated ascenders of the top line; it is an interesting system of annotations, which would possibly reveal some peculiar interests if read alongside an edition of the roman.

	- the miniatures do not attempt to capture the most expressive features described by the poem; they tend to portray the same faces and bodies, only differentiating between gestures; maybe the illuminator was not familiar with the texts; interestingly, however, the personifications are all veiled in a similar fashion.

	- the dreamer is in the __walled garden__ at the center of the this __locus amoenus__; he is looking at the __cycle of images__ painted (or inscribed) on this wall; the reader - and watcher - of the manuscript is therefore performing a mirroring activity.

	- the miniatures are anthropocentric and a support for ekphrasis; the environment is not part of the iconographical project.
