- According to Fulton, Hoccleve himself might have collaborated in the production of Hengwrt and Ellesmere, at times even inventing new lines to supply textual lacunae; Hengwrt was probably assembled while Chaucer was still alive; the tales were __still being arranged__ (e.g. - the _Man of Law_ precedes the _Squire_, the _Manciple_ is in the __middle of the series__); and we find the __famous annotation__ "of this cookes tale|maked chaucer|na moore," added by the same scribe B - Pinkhurst.

	- Codicological evidence supports the option that chaucer deliberately chose to leave the cook's tale unfinished.

	- In Hengwrt, Pinkhurst marked every narrative reading aid with two parallel slashes.

	- The first page of the manuscript is decorated.
