- Ellesmere is the __first ms__ presenting the settled order that we know today, as __transcribed__ in a __single sheet__ attached to the Ms in the xv s. - a "table of contents."

- ethical pointers; narrative reading aids; polemical responses; literary responses.

- The ellesmere glossator adds a story of uxoricide next to the wife of bath's description of her fourth husband; his use of a __sober latin reference__ contrasts the __heated__ tone of the wife, almost identifying the boundary betwen languages with that between genders.

	- most of the glosses to chaucer's tales are in latin; many of these connect the tales of the marriage group to humanist and classical sources; here the most heavily glossed portions are the debates or __polemical sections__.

	- ellesmere contains the __best apparatus of glosses__ it is both possibly authorial and __thoroughly planned__; in the case of the wife of bath's prologue, the glosses consistently refer to the __biblical quotes__ contained in jerome's mysogynistic work, the __adversus jovianum__; they refer to many of the antimatrimonial texts explicitly retained by the poem, but also many __obscure works__ possibly known only to chaucer.

	- the glosses __expand__ and __articulate__ an __ambivalent textual universe__, accessible in __different ways__ by different _kinds_ (tiers) of readers, depending on the degree of __latin literacy__ and knowledge of the sources.

- the ellesmere notoriously contains __twenty-three__ portraits of the pilgrims; these are always portrayed next to the beginning of their own tales; for hilmo, this is a way of __deauthorizing__ chaucer, attributing the tales to this __multiplicity of diverse narrators__.

	- the knight, in his welcoming or greeting attitude, in fact replaces chaucer.

- For mooney and stubbs, pinkhurst might have been in charge of assembling the copies of canterbury after chaucer's death.
