- It contains _Amis and Amiloun_, _Floris and Blancheflour_, _Stanzaic Guy of Warwick_, _Sir Tristrem_, and _Sir Orfeo_.

- In Olson's words, "the largest collection of __middle english__ romances found in any extant ms, also contains __eighteen__ pious and educational works, and an expanded __short metrical chronicle__," which serves as a chronology to situate the characters of the secular tales.

- The Auchinleck is extraordinary because of its preference for __english__ texts over __latin__ and __french__ (very rare at the time); the book is __predominantly english__ both in __language__ and in __content__ - its texts often focus on the __construction of english identity against foreign presences__ (french and "saracens," for instance).

- it is one of the __earliest romance books__ to have survived.

- Seven of its seventeen romances are unique to this manuscript; the remainder are the earliest extant copies, with the exception of __floris and blancheflour__; it is heterogeneous both for __contents__ and __forms__ (couplet, stanzaic, alliterative).

- the scribe of warwick was probably responsible for the whole collection (there are between 5 and 6 hands in it).

	- the two sections of warwick, emphasizing on the military, then religious life of the hero, are written in the same hand and without interruptions, although in a different meter.

- the alternation of __moral__, __didactic__ texts and __engaging__, entertaining tales would therefore be a feature of a __pedagogical volume__, perhaps commissioned by the very __earls of warwick__ for their family.

	- in auchinleck the religious items preceded the secular romances.

- hilmo focuses on the historical context of the ms. production (1130s, after the deposition of the "evil" king edward ii), when hopes for the future of the country were renewed in the form of __values__ drawn from the __english tradition__ (that of the romances collected here); she looks at __5 intact miniatures__.
