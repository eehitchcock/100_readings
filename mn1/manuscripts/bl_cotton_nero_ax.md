#Cotton Nero A.x. - The Gawain MS

|Date| Script |Key Words|
|:--:|:--------:|:-----:|
|c. 1400|Gothic textualis media|Archaizing; Ordinatio; Illumination|

_Ordinatio_ follows metrical changes and narrative units;

- _Features_:
	
	- __c. 1400__; order _pearl_, _cleanness_, _patience_, _gawain_.
		
	- __twelve illustrations__ [illuminations], __four__ for _pearl_, __two__ for _cleanness_, __two__ for _patience_, __four__ for _gawain_ [one would be tempted to assign an importance to these numbers, although it is true that the limner simply chose to fill the white pages at the beginning and at the end of the codex; if there is a hierarchy, therefore, it was imposed onto the text _before_ the limner began working on it].

	- the __hand__ of the ms. is called "__strange__" by _kerby-fulton_; it is a __gothic textualis media__, __archaizing__.

	- we find __red and blue initials__ to mark the sections of the poems; the scribe was allegedly familiar with the different metrical forms, and the __ordinatio__ changes subtly throughout the ms.

	- there are no images of __god__ or the __virgin__, possibly because lollardy - which strongly opposed the portrayal of divinity - had already influenced this aspect of book production.

	- the images were undoubtedly painted after the completion of the ms (although they might have been drawn at the same time).

	- __interestingly__, the image of gawain at the green chapel perfectly mirrors the first one - gawain as the __rider__/__intruder__, the giant as the axe-wielding protector of the household.
