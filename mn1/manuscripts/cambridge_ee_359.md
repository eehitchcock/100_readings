- probably [almost certainly] matthew paris; original was composed for queen eleanor of provence between 1236 and 1272; this is a london-westminster copy.

- it was probably part of a project of promotion of westminster abbey.

- matthew paris was a monk and chronicler at st. albans.

- on the first page we can notice the _ordinatio_, alternating blue and red litterae nobiliores, distinguishing between [signalling breaks between] expositive and argumentative units [that is, not their alternation - they do not alternate - only the boundaries of each unit]; the second page exemplifies the actual structure of the book, with the image occupying three columns, and bearing latin inscriptions (rubricated, _these will later disappear, and reappear in different scripts and hands_); the __rubric__, clarifying the contents of the image and engaging a sort of __conversation__ with the reader (_not always that systematic; the sort of extradiegetic, auxiliary function of the rubric is quickly replaced by a running summary of the entire text_; in __couplets__ as well, as a sort of running summary of the book_). we find __three layers__ of readability - the image, the rubric, and the full text (paradoxically, the text of the miniature is in __latin__; was this a strategy to reach an international - or multilingual - audience?).
