##General Introduction

- The book focuses on the specific connection between __grammatical and rhetorical theory__ and __theoretical approaches to literature__; that is, from _grammar_ to _theory_.

- __Grammar__ included also _literature_ and the _analysis of literary texts_ (_philology_); __rhetoric__ included _form and style_ in any kind of writing.

- The text which discussed these two disciplines (subjects) were mainly _pedagogical_.

- - -

- The book presents __first__ foundational texts, __then__ texts that exemplify the impact of these foundations.

- - -

- The periods of greatest expansion of these two fields were the __XII__ and __XIII__ centuries.

- - -

- Complex tree of subjects: __language arts__ in their application to __literary culture__ are the main trunk; __grammar__ will later separate from the rest and become part of __philosophy__ (as _speculative grammar_); __rhetoric__ will split into _ars dictaminis_ and _ars praedicandi_.

###Classification of knowledge

- There was a certain obsession with the classification of the sciences in the Middle Ages.

- From Aristotle's _Metaphysics_ comes the first distinction, between _practical_ (that which can be affected by knowledge) and _theoretical_ (that which can only be known, not changed or affected); this dichotomy will become the __pi__ and the __theta__ on Lady Philosophy's cloak (Boethius).

	- Another division: __logic__, __physics__ and __ethics__ (Stoics).

	- Another division: the __Organon__ (from Aristotle's homonymous book in six parts; plus _Rhetoric_ and _Poetics_).

	- Another division: the __trivium__ (arts of __language__) and the __quadrivium__ (arts of __numerical measurement__).

- Each model was plastic and adaptable. They keep changing because they are always considered __insufficient__.

	- They are also a way of achieving a number of _translatio studii_ (ancient to contemporary; Latin to vernacular), and teaching the order of antiquity.

- The basis of this problem of classification seems to be the hierarchy between __language__ and __knowledge__: which one comes first? Which one is essential to the other (knowledge, in most cases; so much that true knowledge would coincide with the __quadrivium__ in most cases; the _trivium_ would only be necessary to teach and to express the truths discovered by the _quadrivium_.

- "The notion that language and reasoning are unified is certainly essential to the Stoic understanding of "logic" as a division of knowledge. It is also implicit in Boethius' treatment of the topics of dialectic and rhetoric: the same reasoning is involved, but the two arts use different methods (the syllogism versus the enthymeme) and are aimed at different kinds of objects (the thesis versus the hypothesis)."

	- __Dialectic__ ---> __Syllogism__ ---> __Thesis__
	
	- __Rhetoric__ ---> __Enthymeme__ ---> __Hypothesis__

- A division based "on an ancient and deeper distinction between __things__ and __words__, _wisdom_ and _eloquence_."

- Two purposes for treatises of late antiquity:

	- "to erect _encyclopedic defenses_ against the dispersal and loss of ancient learning" (Martianus Capella, Isidore);

	- to achieve the "_translatio studii_ from the pagan to the Christian imperium" (Cassiodorus);

		- the classification scheme would work as a sort of "library" or "holding structure" for this knowledge - a scaffolding which would indicate the spaces that are yet to be filled.

	- The purpose of __classification__ is mainly __preservation__.

		- Classification often entailed the creation of a dedicated _canon_ (a list of pedagogical texts that ought to be used to teach a subject).
