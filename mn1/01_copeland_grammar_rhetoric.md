##General Introduction

- The book focuses on the specific connection between __grammatical and rhetorical theory__ and __theoretical approaches to literature__; that is, from _grammar_ to _theory_.

- __Grammar__ included also _literature_ and the _analysis of literary texts_ (_philology_); __rhetoric__ included _form and style_ in any kind of writing.

- The text which discussed these two disciplines (subjects) were mainly _pedagogical_.

- - -

- The book presents __first__ foundational texts, __then__ texts that exemplify the impact of these foundations.

- - -

- The periods of greatest expansion of these two fields were the __XII__ and __XIII__ centuries.

- - -

- Complex tree of subjects: __language arts__ in their application to __literary culture__ are the main trunk; __grammar__ will later separate from the rest and become part of __philosophy__ (as _speculative grammar_); __rhetoric__ will split into _ars dictaminis_ and _ars praedicandi_.

###Classification of knowledge

- There was a certain obsession with the classification of the sciences in the Middle Ages.

- From Aristotle's _Metaphysics_ comes the first distinction, between _practical_ (that which can be affected by knowledge) and _theoretical_ (that which can only be known, not changed or affected); this dichotomy will become the __pi__ and the __theta__ on Lady Philosophy's cloak (Boethius).

	- Another division: __logic__, __physics__ and __ethics__ (Stoics).

	- Another division: the __Organon__ (from Aristotle's homonymous book in six parts; plus _Rhetoric_ and _Poetics_).

	- Another division: the __trivium__ (arts of __language__) and the __quadrivium__ (arts of __numerical measurement__).

- Each model was plastic and adaptable. They keep changing because they are always considered __insufficient__.

	- They are also a way of achieving a number of _translatio studii_ (ancient to contemporary; Latin to vernacular), and teaching the order of antiquity.

- The basis of this problem of classification seems to be the hierarchy between __language__ and __knowledge__: which one comes first? Which one is essential to the other (knowledge, in most cases; so much that true knowledge would coincide with the __quadrivium__ in most cases; the _trivium_ would only be necessary to teach and to express the truths discovered by the _quadrivium_.

- "The notion that language and reasoning are unified is certainly essential to the Stoic understanding of "logic" as a division of knowledge. It is also implicit in Boethius' treatment of the topics of dialectic and rhetoric: the same reasoning is involved, but the two arts use different methods (the syllogism versus the enthymeme) and are aimed at different kinds of objects (the thesis versus the hypothesis)."

	- __Dialectic__ ---> __Syllogism__ ---> __Thesis__
	
	- __Rhetoric__ ---> __Enthymeme__ ---> __Hypothesis__

- A division based "on an ancient and deeper distinction between __things__ and __words__, _wisdom_ and _eloquence_."

- Two purposes for treatises of late antiquity:

	- "to erect _encyclopedic defenses_ against the dispersal and loss of ancient learning" (Martianus Capella, Isidore);

	- to achieve the "_translatio studii_ from the pagan to the Christian imperium" (Cassiodorus);

		- the classification scheme would work as a sort of "library" or "holding structure" for this knowledge - a scaffolding which would indicate the spaces that are yet to be filled.

	- The purpose of __classification__ is mainly __preservation__.

		- Classification often entailed the creation of a dedicated _canon_ (a list of pedagogical texts that ought to be used to teach a subject).

			- A __reading list__ (many of the sort existed).

- "In antiquity, there was no doubt that the discipline that dealt with analysis of poetry was grammar, and in pedagogical practice this continued throughout the Middle Ages: poetry remained the object of grammatical explication."

	- Definition of the different domains of science: highly problematic; therefore, between grammar and rhetoric there was not always an easy distinction.

- "On the other hand, the twelfth and especially thirteenth centuries also saw a competing move within the art of grammar to look at language, not as literature, but as __the object of logic__."

	- _Grammar = Language +_ __Literature__ versus _Grammar = Language +_ __Logic__ (XII s. is the distinction)

	- The field that is entirely or uniquely devoted to the study of literature therefore becomes __poetics__.

- The scientific classification of the arts lends itself easily to poetical depictions and imagery; the scientific classification of the arts is also a mirror of the physiological or intellectual organization of the human mind.

###Grammar: The Logic of Language and the "Reading Road"

- Grammar explains __how language works__ (it can precede _logic_; it can be the foundation of logic).

- Grammar was related to __dialectic__; dialectic was the science of determining _what is true and what is false_.

- "In antiquity, the philosophical ideas that would most penetrate later grammatical thought were those developed in __the Stoa__."

- The crucial link is between linguistic categories and philosophical (logical) categories; the categories of grammar - the _noun_ and the _verb_, for instance - acquire an __extraordinary ontological value__.

- "Priscian etymologizes _litera_ ("letter") as _leg-iter-a_ (the "reading road") - it would provide a _path for reading_. [...] The derivation is certainly linked to the fact that literature (not logic) was the oldest domain for the study of language, and that grammarians were not just "guardians of language" but "guardians of literature."

- "Thus the __philosophical dimension of language__ worked in concert with __textual analysis__."

- Division between __genus didascalicum__ (instruction), __genus dramaticum__ (debate), and __genus hermeneuticum__ (exposition to an audience); very influential, found in _William of Conches_, commenting Priscian.

- The crucial problem of _relatio_ (syntactic and lexical): _woman_ is both Eve (condemner) and Mary (savior) - "woman who damned the world saved the world" - "mulier que dapnavit salvavit."

	- Think, of course, about __Piers Plowman__.

- "Grammatical theory, even when applied to literary criticism, was everywhere permeated with the most fundamental logical questions of substance and accident, matter and form, what can be expressed and what is meant, signification and reference, ambiguity and equivocation."

	- "The early-twelfth-century _Glosule_ on Priscian determine in the most finely calibrated ways how substance inheres in a verb, and therefore how the difference between a noun and a verb allows us to understand the difference between signifying substance in itself (noun) and substance that coheres with action (verb)."

- "The understanding of language in terms of its referential function opens out into questions about the mechanics of representation. Logicians were not directly or primarily concerned with poetic ("artistic" or "fictive") representation; but the question of how words relate to things led commentators on logical texts to consideration of the status of fictive (or "imaginative") constructs that mediate between the things that we perceive and the language that we use to express thought."

	- This seems, again, incredibly relevant for __PP__. Langland as an incredibly aware writer of literature, playing with language as a tool of ontological (logical) exploration or disruption.

	- The book that is quoted here is Aristotle's _De Interpretatione_; an analysis of "how meaningful expressions are formed." Aristotle attaches importance to the notion of (spoken) words as symbols of "mental impressions" or "impressions in the soul."

		- Amazing stuff here. From Aristotle we move onto __Boethius__ and __Abelard__. This is an exploration of how language creates things - they "attempted to explain _passiones in anima_ or mental impressions and their relation to the words that we use."

		- Great pages here (23-24). "Mental concepts (to which words refer) cannot come into being, Boethius asserts, without _imaginationes_, (imaginations or images); according to Boethius, an _imaginatio_ (a mental image, associated with the mental faculty of processing what is taken in by the senses) is a _prima figura_ (a "first outline"), just like the outlines or archetypes (_lineae_) that painters first make of their subjects."
