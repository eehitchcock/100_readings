|Language arts; Glossing; Political power|Irvine outlines the history of the metalanguage of grammatica, the discourse that prescribed both the reception and the production of written texts; he focuses on how it influenced and was deployed by various institutions of power, until s. XIII.|

- Grammatica was also an __instrument of power__ - consider its reinvention in the Carolingian period, and its appropriation and regulation by the Church. Grammatica is a __metalanguage__.

##Introduction

- 1: "the art [or science] of interrogating the poets and other writers and the principles for speaking and writing correctly"
	- it is, therefore, twofold: understanding and expressing.
	- it also had wide social implications, since it constituted an exclusive access to literacy and an intellectual community.

- 2: grammatica included a canon, a language, and a style.
	- it was the irriducible cultural prerequisite.

- 3: grammatica as a _series of glosses_, on the model of late antiquity. it had two levels:
	1. litteratio (training in reading and writing);
	2. litteratura (the interpretation of texts).
		- the definition on the first page was by __diomedes__ (IV s.)
		- there's a number of different names for these two parts - _ratio scribendi/loquendi_ and _scientia interpretandi_.

- 4: Grammatica was eminently textual - meaning, concerned with __writing__.
	- it was also a model for every form of writing.
	- interpretation was composed of three [four?] parts:
		1. lectio (reading aloud);
		2. enarratio (exposition and interpretation of figures);
		3. emendatio (editorial interventions on authenticity and language);
		4. iudicium (critical evaluation).

- 5: the most debated division of interpretation was, of course, enarratio.
	- this general _methodological model_ remained more or less the same from __i__ s. b.c.e. to __xii__ s. c.e.

- 6: from this __useful chart__ of the divisions of grammar we learn that a specific subgenre corresponded to each division: 
	- e.g.: interlineal glosses for lectio and marginal for enarratio;
	- this methodology was also absorbed by vernacular authors.

- 7: the first three artes soon became an indistinguishable entity.

- 8: 15% of latin ms. surviving up to the __viii__ s. is devoted to grammatica.
	- after liturgical and biblical texts, grammatical ms. are the most numerous.

- 9: introduces a __chart__ (synoptic) of all grammatica texts (or principal ones) from __i__ b.c.e. to __xi__ c.e.; it is surprising how few of these there actually are. the clusters are __roman__ _artes_ and insular and carolingian _artes and commentaries_. although density is clearly distinct from importance.
	- apart from these major sources, irvine has collected data from very diverse genres (from ecyclopedias to biblical commentaries).

- 12-15: here it is introduced the idea of a continuity between grammatica and __legislation__. according to irvine, this relationship was in constant flux; besides this flux - this relationship - could be manipulated for political reasons. grammatica, being the sole existing access to literacy and education, was __power__. examples of this employment of grammatica include charlemagne and king alfred.

- 14-15: grammatica, in its connection to writing, was also the access to religion, and the privileged means through which reason could _transcend time_.
	- it also contributed to the creation of textual communities, by establishing a canon and an interpretive method used to understand its authors.

- 16: at the moment when the book was written (1994) the idea of longue duree for grammatica was new (fairly new); it had to be explored in its social implications.
	- for irvine, grammatica should now be studied in its methodological, widely epistemic connotations, as the __privileged metalanguage__ of knowledge, as one of the "practices that systematically form the objects of which they speak."

- 17: irvine will take into account the peculiarities of manuscripts and medieval reading.

- 19-20: irvine is eager to prove that grammatica was never neither exclusively concerned with religious texts (_the classical canon survived_), nor with language alone.

- 21: literacy is always a social construct - not an absolute faculty.
	- irvinge mentions: technology, semiology, orthography, readership, authorship.

##Chapter 1: The formation of grammatical within classical discursive practices

- 23-24: the first condition for the establishment of grammatica was the inception of a _metalanguage_; this was an elaborate and deliberate process.
	- the relationship between linguistics and criticism started in the hellenistic era.

- 25: the starting point of the metalinguistic turn is found within plato's discussion of the _logos_: with him, logos became organized thought.
	- the basic distinction is that between _onomata_ and _rhemata_ (what is __said about__ names); logos studies the ways in which they interact.

- 26-27: presentation of phaedrus and the limits of writing (_grammata_) according to plato; it harms the act of memory, and it cannot respond.
	- therefore, uncapable of responding, texts can only be __analyzed__.

- 28-29: soon logos became, in any case, synonimous with _gramma_. spoken language - any language - could only be understood and explained through writing.
	- eventually, after the hellenistic period, writing is considered superior to speech, since it serves as memory (and a requisite to knowledge).

- 30: in plato we also find the first meditation on the value of poetical language and tropes - allegory was condemned because it was deceiving/
	- this is another reason for which writing is dangerous: __it is always allegory__.

- 31: aristotle organized and promoted the use of logos as a principal method.
	- the whole middle ages are indepted to his wide systematization.

- 33: aristotle also introduces an important notion about poetry: it uses both __signification__ and __mimesis__ (it simultaneously signifies and represents).

- 35: for the __stoics__, grammatike was one of the two parts of dialektike; this distinguished between _things signified_ and _things signifying_. grammatike corresponded to the organization of the latter, from linguistic to poetic.
	- the notion about the _mimetic_ quality of poetry is absolutely fascinating.

- 37: "the stoics considered _nature_, and hence human discourse, the corporeal vehicle of meaning and a manifestation of logos, to be a system of signs structured by the immanent logos." here is alain de lille: "poetry is a sign of deeper structure in the nature of things."
	- this causes an overlapping between _nature and naming_; anomalies in language usually reveal deeper ways in which language embodies nature.
	- this also creates an identification between the exegete and the oracle;
	- etymology and allegory, at different levels, both reveal deep connections between nature and language (words for the first, texts for the second).

- 38: the conclusion of this trajectory is precisely in the distinction between __signifier__ and __signified__. this allowed for the birth of _linguistic_ and _allegorical_ (interpretive) discourses.

- 39: in the hellenistic period, grammatike becomes an established techne.

- 40: the great invention that contributed to the spread of the techne grammatike was certainly the __library__ - the grammatical archive.
	- the library was also a crucial _political institution_.
	- here we also see the appearance of the _professional intellectual_, one possessing a higher form of knowledge.

- 42: in alexandria we also see the rise of the canon - and therefore of authors and genres; classics and textual taxonomy.
	- here we also find the first systematic grammar (for classical greek);
	- think about an encyclopedic project that is, by nature, also an __imperialistic project__; assimilation and control of all books.

- 44: an important notion: "in grammatical culture, a text is always the text-as-read, not something that pre-exists its articulate, vocal production."
	- in hellenic schools we find the first attempts at classifying tropes.

- 46: an important feature of grammar is its essential __receptivity__: it is a passive science ("an art of interpretation, description, definition, criticism"), not an active one, like rhetorike ("an art of prescription, persuasion, expression). its end is __meaning__.

- 47: the conclusive model of hellenic grammar distinguishes between three parts of grammatike:
	1. historikon: narrative content (true, fictional, myth);
	2. technikon (grammar and linguistic rules);
	3. idiateron (poetry and exegesis; _specific_).

##Chapter 2: The developing model of grammatica in the Roman and Early Medieval world

- 49: in roman times the knowledge of grammatike became a prerequisite for social prestige and political power; only trained grammarians rose.

- 50: grammar was initially taught in greek; bilingualism was a requisite for all.
	- later on, from _translation_, the ideal of a national literature was born; this had, of course, strong political implications (nationalism, imperialism);
		- _and what if we did not consider Chaucer the end - but, instead, see the earlier stage - bilingualism, as autonomous - without a telos?_

- 51: important codificators at this stage are varro and suetonius.
	- varro first established the system of disciplines which will become the seven artes.

- 54: in general, grammarians like quintilian seem mostly concerned with the teaching of grammar; it was "a program designed to prepare a student for rhetoric and public life."

- 56: __artes__ were the _latin schoolbooks_ of late antiquity (350-500 c.e.); there were mainly two kinds of artes: encyclopedic treatises and school texts; a third type was devoted to _regulae_ (guides to inflections).

- 57: these manuals were not language textbooks; they presupposed _latin as a native language_.

- 58: among the most influential textbooks we have dyomedes and __aelius donatus__ - the latter being the author of "ars grammatica," the most successful textbook ever written: "for centuries the only point of entry into the literate world.
	- donatus discussed both the _ratio scribendi_ and the _enarratio auctorum_.

- 61: the second most influential textbook was priscian's _institutiones grammaticae_, focused only in language, parts of speech, and syntax; it was written in the vi s., but it became widely popular after the viii s.

- 68-69: here begins an exposition of lectio: __lectio__ precedes the moment of enarratio (interpretation); reading aloud (and expressively, with different intonation and voice according to the subject matter) was a prerequisite for intrepretation. a written text does not exist by itself.

- 71: reading out loud also implied the preliminary pauses which would lead to __punctuation__; syntax and sense were determined by the reader at this point.
	- punctuation was in fact first introduced as a pedagogical tool; a guide to correct reading out loud, that would lead the reader to __autonomy__.

- 74: orthography and normativization soon acquired ideological importance. they were employed to establish an "authoritative monologism," especially in the early Christian context. the three criteria which led to the formulation of laws were _consuetudo_, _ratio_, _auctoritas_.
	- __auctoritas__ slowly became the leading criterion to assess a rule.

- 75: a major turning point in the iv s.: textual and linguistic matters are combined under the larger category of "correctness" and "authenticity"
	- emendatio (editorial authority) merged into __orthographia__ (linguistic correctness).

- 76: here we find a great quotation from _agroecius'_ "de orthographia" (450~): "nothing which petains to us is outside your correction [...] from living to writing, from the mind to the hand, form the heart to the finger."

- 77: "latinitas," the correct way of writing in latin, is based on the auctoritas of a past canon.
	- notice that we are still discussing _late antiquity_ (up to 476 c.e.)

- 79: the authority mediated by grammarians influenced:
	1. the curricula and programs of schools;
	2. social practices: literacy, the canon, written authority.
		- the chief auctoritas and greatest classic was __vergil__; he was chosen by grammarians.

- 83: through the example of _statius_, who marked within an intertextual tradition, rewriting old library books, irvine explains how grammar prompted new literary forms. with _grammatica_ authors were always recided of tradition.

- 86: irvine reminds us that __historia__ as well was constructed through grammatica.
	- historia was the narrative exposition of auctoritas and its empire.

##Chapter 3: Linguistic foundations

- 88: irvine's goal seems to be a statement about a preservation of the __metalanguage of grammar__, even when its objects (the vernacular, the canon authors) changed;
	- the main transformation was a change in the _auctores_; grammatica survived.

- 89: the concern was also religious: how could grammatica be repurposed for _christianity_?

- 90: here we find a phenomenal __chart__ with _partes orationis_ from plato to donatus.
	- the artes (textbooks) were adapted to linguistic communities of non-romance peoples (irish, anglo-saxon), becoming the first foreign language grammars.

- 91: "the model for articulate speech is writing, and the model for the theory of writing is canonical writing" - like virgil's aeneid - "writing informs speech"

- 92: the discussion of __voice__ has deep implications; for now we gather that speech was that sound which was passible of __transcription__ (struck voice that can be written). the artes also refer to music and animal sounds.

- 94: irvine successfully parallels priscian's theory of speech with saussure's.

- 94: the object of grammar is __vox articulata__ (meaningful) __litterata__ (scribable).
	- this is an artificial object, capable of including _christian_ writing as well.

- 100: the minimal unit of _vox_ - speech - is the __littera__ - it is an atom, like in physics.
	- litterae were elementa - irreducible parts of the world; this had also religious value.
	- the origin of letters had, in fact, many myths surrounding it.

- 104: tropes and poetical discourse posed a different problem; but they had been theorized.
	- aristotle described metaphors and tropes as _deviations from the "dominant"_; medieval artes inherited that herory, and mantained tropes as linguistic vitia.

- 106: nevertheless, medieval grammarians were concerned with the taxonomy of tropes.

- 107: artes were always produced through the combination of __metalanguage__ and __canon__.

- 108: virgil was, for instance, ubiquitous in grammars; donatus has 119 quotations from him.

- 110: as monks and missionaries adapted these artes from the use of non-romance people on the islands, their canon shifted from latinitas to christianity.
	- nevertheless, virgil survived; he was no longer cultural scripture - only linguistic.

- 117: by juxtaposing roman and christian sources, these texts achieved a _sense of continuity_.

##Chapter 4: Enarratio 1 - Commentaries on Vergil

- 118: the chapter focuses on the grammmatical theory implied in commentaries to Vergil

- 120: we find here a synthesis of irvine's major claims:
	1. grammatica had an __idelolgical__ value in the communities which it served;
	2. the focus of the _commentaries_ was pure _textual form_ - neither the author nor the content;
		- there is, however, a tendency to include _allegorical_ (imperialist or protchristian) value onto the texts; notice that auctor refers to a text, not a historical person.

- 121: "the vergil commentaries disclose that all commentary, beyond purely lexical or grammatical clarification, is __allegorical__." allegory is secondariness.
	- irvine then comments on the _accessus_, the preface to a text; these were a sort of _mark-up_, or metadata, including _locus_, _tempus_, _persona_, then _causa scribendi_. at times there could be a _vita_; and then more details.

- 123: in the vita, canonical (or ideological) information was often merged with _hagiography_.

- 125: irvine seems to suggest that the theory of styles mught have been taught through virgil's life - his bucolic imitation of theocritos, the agricultural and the epic.

- 126: "servius's commentary on vergil's works, __in virgilii carmina commentarius__, is the most important and the most influential commentary of a classic in the M. A."

- 129: there are two models of commentary: _text and gloss format_ (with the primary text at the center of the page), and _lemma and running commentary format_ (the lemmata, often rubricated, are part of the same block of text).

- 131: looking at servius's accessus, the focus on the author's intentio is strikingly modern.

- 132: servius commentary included (a good example here): 
	- grammar and language; 
	- elucidation of context;
	- style and tropes;
	- vocabulary;
	- philosophy and religion;
	- literary tradition.
		- it is a fascinating method, that proceeds __word by word__; allegory similarly.

- 135: according to servius, vergil's intention was "to praise augustus and to imitate homer."
	- he therefore finds traces of this intention everywhere in the book; this is _allegory_.

- 140: by drawing on the conception of vergil as arcan of encyclopedic knowledge, servius also used his commentary as an encyclopedia, including _ethics_ and _religion_.
	- in the figmenta of vergil, therefore, we find philosophical truths from plato to lucretius; servius is exploring openly other primary sources through his own secondary.

- 141: :servius's work is both an _index to_ and a _determinant of_ a form of textuality that was non-historicist and semiotic, based on an intertextual network of auctores."

- 142: now irvine discusses macrobius __saturnalia__, a commentary written as a symposium.
	- it is a debate on the idelogical implecations of the grammatical method.

- 147: macrobius discusses the greek and early latin sources of vergil exstensively.
	- his commentary established, or tried to establish, a new canon of classics.

- 154: christian commentaries simply added their own encyclopedia to the texts.

- 157: the last example, fulgentius, is that of a __dialogue__ where vergil interprets himself.
	- it is a dramatization of the grammatical context; _dante_ certainly knew it well.

- 161: irvine claims that, although the system of canonical auctores was crucial, there was _no notion of "literature"_ in medieval times; only textuality.
	- vergil was a religious and ethical text, considered for its ideological features.

##Chapter 5: Grammatica and medieval textual communities - Alexandria to Isidore

- 162: christian textual communities first formed around the necessity of revising the teaching of grammar for the new communities; a new canon of texts had to be defined.
	- the thesis of this chapter is about the longue duree, the continuity, from hellenism to this.
	- the shift is from the adaptation of a preexisting method to the creation of a __new one__.
	- "the founding of the christian school at alexandria by pantaneus [...] was one of the most significant events in the history of textual culture."

- 163: this school in alexandria was the site of a new christian grammatike (canon and method).
	- the curriculum was perfectioned by two of its directors: __clement__ and __origen__.

- 165: with clement we have the culmination of a parable that, from the stoics onwards, identifies __allegory as a means to achieve transcentent truths__.

- 166: origen wrote the first extensive commentaries to christian scriptures; he was crucial for the repurposing of grammatike for the needs of _christian paideia_.

- 169: when augustine was writing, the debate over grammar had become an _ideological_ one.
	- irvine's intention here is to reappropriate Augustine as a theorist of grammar.

- 171: "knowledge was always for augustine a question of reading the right books in the right way; reading was therefore an exercise in untying knots, penetrating obscurities."

- 178: "de doctrina cristiana" is augustine's cardinal contribution to grammatica; it is a method of interpretation that christianizes classicity and incorporates christianity.

- 179: augustine treats the scripture as __a literary text__ that has to be interpreted; simultaneously, he turns classical literature into _secular literature_; they're safe.

- 182: "obscurity was placed in the scriptures so that readers might have more pleasure in the discovery of _hidden meaning_;" grammar avoids the __risk of heterodoxy__.

- 186: like the classical canon, the scriptures contain every trope; language, when limited to its "proper" sense, is __insufficient__. tropes are ubiquitous.

- 195: also here, with gregory, irvine seems more concerned with __reappropriation__ than exposition.

- 208: the discussion of cassiodorus is not especially captivating. again, more of a reappropriation.

- 214: "in isidore's model, writing is a memory system or archive, a system of continuous deferral, which makes _absent_ and _past experience_ present." irvine is here mostly trying to connect isidore to his predecessors.

- 234: by the time when isidore was writing (636~), classical literature had become so distant from its religious origins that his _etymologiae_ could rely entirely on it - it contains no quotations from the christian canon.

- 241: according to irvine, the game of etymologiae reveals how often the medieval author could consider himself or herself as a _compilator_: his book is compilatio.

##Chapter 6: Enarratio II - Interpretation and the Grammar of Allegory

- 245: in both classical and christian traditions, the trope and its interpretation could both be called "allegory"; __all interpretation is allegorical__.

- 246: two features of the enarratio of allegory:
	- allegorical interpretation is embodied in the commentary, which is a self-standing rewriting of the primary text, stripped form ambiguity; __the commentary is completely unambiguous__;
	- the form of the commentary should be _zero degree writing_, univocal.

- 248: these assumptions about the interpretation of allegory depend on a distinction first found in aristotle - between "_proper discourse_" and "_trope_".

- 249: in _grammatica_, allegory is the quality of statements where __a secondary meaning__ is added to the primary sense of a statement. allegory works through _addition_.
	- for irvine, it is crucial to realize that this model applies to any enarratio.

- 259: augustine establishes the substantial difference between __typology__ and __allegory__: tropes (figurative expressions) and figures of future events.

- 263: here we have a dense, but very useful, discussion of allegory. "in allegory, the sense of an expression bears a mark of __deficient or absurd__ meaning, idicating its lack and its status as a _signifier of additional or supplementary meaning_. in typology the reference of a statement has priority, and historical referents signified in the text are marked as _insufficient in their mere factuality_ and become signifiers of additional meaning.
	- this is the so-called __grammar of interpretation__. Allegory is vertical; typology horizontal.

- 265: here irvine introduces the notion of _semiotic anxiety_: isn't exegetical practice an admission that a text is by definition polysemous (especially the scripture), and therefore capable of lending itself to __heterodoxy__?
	- the answer: like _god_ (the _logos_), the text is __one__, but contains __many__ (all).

##Chapter 7: Grammatica and textual culture in Anglo-saxon England and Carolingian Europe

- 272: the triad of intellectuals who exported grammatica to the insular world are _adhelm_ (d. 709), _bede_ (d. 735), and _alcuin_ (d. 814). that is s. __viii-ix__.
	- again, irvine's thesis is that _grammatica_ was the essential discipline for them.

- 278: Bede quotes vergil often; he probably had first-hand knowledge of his writing.

- 288: Bede's rigorously grammatical works are: _de arte metrica_, _de schematibus et tropis_, _de orthographia_; they cover _lectio_, _enarratio_, and _emendatio_.

- 305: "grammatica was without question the chief discipline associated with the carolingian _renovatio_ of literary culture"; (we could probably say that, in anglo-saxon england, grammatica simply became rooted in religious discourse)

- 306: the pedagogical and cultural project of charlemagne depended on the systematization and spread of grammatica - something for which the __caroline script__ was crucial (it was easy to read and to transcribe); grammatica was here fundamental for ideology. the goal of this _reorganization_ was normativization and authority.
	- alcuin is the link between anglo-saxon monasteries and the carolingian renovatio;
	- this is the crucial example of grammatica as a __technology__ used by power.

- 324: alcuin's treatises are _de grammatica_ and _de rhetorica_; they prescribe a pedagogical and interpretive method - he, for instance, identified the "seven artes" with a path to _sapientia_. His concern was also _ideological_ and _ethical_.

##Chapter 8: The genres of grammatical culture and manuscript textuality

- 334: the _library catalogue_ or inventory is a _new genre_ in the late viii s.
	- the grammatical _artes_ were books _about the library_, and the only ones.
	- irvine's goal in this chapter is to establish their position in the __library's order__.

- 344: "grammatica functioned as the _chief metalanguage_ of the library system - a metabibliotheca, as it were, referring to all the texts in the library."
	- compilatio was one of the ways in which artes were _intertextual_.

- 345: the practice of _autonomous booklets of gatherings_ composing a longer codex was especially common for _artes_; irvine shows some examples.

- 354: compilatio was a common genre, due to the intertextual nature of grammatica.

- 385: from the __viii__ s. on, most manuscripts associated with grammatica, especially with the auctores, reveal a _standard method of textual placement on the page_.

- 392: "the __margins__ are the space of the _signified_; the __center__ [...] the space of the _signifier_.

##Chapter 9: The implications of Grammatical Culture in Anglo-Saxon England

- 409: the specificity of Grammatica in Anglo-Saxon England is its interplay between Latin and English traditions, resulting in a _hybrid grammatica_ mixing insular and carolingian influences.
	- English vernacular literary culture thus preceded anything like it on the continent by __two centuries__; it was a "__bilingual, intertextual__ system"

- 414: Aelfric's _grammatica_ is formed of a _grammatical metalanguage_ (in Old English) and a Latin object language; but Alfric's metalanguage is __bilingual__. the key-word for the culture born here is "in utraque lingua": hybrid textuality.

- 416: alfred's political project was this __bilingualism__: he promoted "literacy in __both latin and english__;" grammatica becomes a "discipline of both languages."

- 448: irvine's aim in this section is to show how many Old English canonical texts were indebted to forms found in the _artes grammaticae_; one example is the _bilingual, self-interpreting allegory (enigma)_ "Dream of the Rood"

##Chapter 10: Conclusion

- 461: Irvine reiterates that grammatica was considered the __access__ to both sapientia and philosophia.

- 463: we have here an _anticipation_ of what will follow: grammatica lost some of its status due to the _introduction of universities_ and the spread of aristotle's new translations (the study of _metaphysics_). the auctores and methods of grammatica were dropped from _university curricula_. grammar was split into three divisions: theoretical grammar; poetics; the glosses. Nevertheless, grammatica remained the model for __literary theory__.
