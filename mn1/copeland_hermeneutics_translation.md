#Rita Copeland - Rhetoric, Hermeneutics and Translation in the Middle Ages

- __Introduction__

	- the book intends to explore the relationship between __vernacular translation__ and the __language arts__; __translation__ should be placed between __hermeneutics__ and __rhetoric__ (__interpretation__ and __invention__).

	- its focus is that of __medieval critical practices__; but also on practices (and theories) of __translation__; as cicero defined them, the two poles were translation as "__interpreter__" and translation as "__orator__" (word by word or "creatively" _sense-for-sense_).

	- the crucial problem is the __overlapping__ of rhetoric and grammar, "__inventio__" (creative) and __enarratio__ (hermeneutical).

	- the background and the purpose of __medieval translation__ was often an __appropriation__ of __latin tradition__ - especially the __academic discourse__ [as we know from later sections of the book, this entailed a transference of _prestige_ and, possibly, _power_ - but not its elision].

	- tradition [possibly _translation_] was strictly connected to the __commentary tradition__, where commentaries often rewrote or __supplanted__ the "master" text.

	- the book is mostly focused on translations of __auctores__ (boethius and ovid), rather than "__popular__" translations like __lais__ or __romances__ [but might these observe the same set of principles?].

	- __copeland__ presents the __late antique__ developments of __translation theory__ between __rhetoric__ and __hermeneutic__; how some translations developed from - or supplanted - commentaries; how some translations (__primary__) were aligned with __interpretation__, while others (__secondary__) with __invention__; some were __interlingual__ (straight from the __latin__) and others __intralingual__ (considering __vernacular translations__ as a __source__), thus replacing the original text [in a hierarchical sense as well; a replacement of __auctoritas__]; the vernacular translation __displaces__ and __appropriates__ its materials through __exegesis__ and __invention__.

1. _Roman theories of translation: the fusion of grammar and rhetoric_

	- medieval translation theory inherited from antiquity ideas like the contrast between "__literal__" and "__loose__" translations, but also broader issues - like __medieval translation__, latin translation had to __mediate__ between __rhetoric__ and __grammar__.

	- in __roman artes__, translation was linked with __literary imitation__ (from the standpoint of __rhetoric__) and __commentary__ (from the standpoint of __grammar__); it was also a __marginal issue__, often considered as little more than a school exercise; it became important with the __bilingualism__ of the empire and __hellenistic culture__, which implied a need for a transformation of __latin__ as well [that is, through the _exercitatio_ of translation, latin texts had to incorporate new terms and possibly new concepts; this produced an expansion and an enhanced flexibility of language].

	- __rhetoric__ included the study of the __ethical__ and __social__ aspects of language; grammar did not (rhetoric was __praxis__, grammar was __episteme__); but at times __hermeneutic__ could become a __praxis__ - at times its operation had to __incorporate__ the __circumstances__ of the interpreter (subject, audience, moment); at times __interpretation__ had to be rhetorical (an act of __linguistic creation__).

	- __translation__ and __imitation__ often overlapped; but translation aimed at __replacing the source__ (and the culture that produced it), while imitation was intended as an __organic continuation__ of a __project__ [and a broader tradition]; from the standpoint of __method__, this matched __inventio__ and __enarratio__ [this is a complicated step; does imitation correspond to inventio - the production of original content - or to enarratio - the expansion of a preexistent source? and what about translation? the problematic correspondence is probably part of copeland's argument], the boundary between passive hermeneutic and active creation (or rhetoric; __literal__ - __loose__); all ideas that reached the m. a. [i. e., middle ages].

2. _From antiquity to the middle ages 1: the place of translation and the value of hermeneutics_

	- the relationship between __rhetoric__ and __translation__ was transmitted to the __middle ages__ and the practices of __vernacular__ through __rhetorical compendia__ and __patristic writings__.

	- the __latin manuals__ of __late antiquity__ (iv s. c. e.) emphasized __inventio__ over the other parts of __ciceronian rhetoric__; the focus on __invention__ caused a separation of __rhetoric__ from its __social__ and __political__ relevance, from the needs of __praxis__ [the actual reason for this detachment is not entirely transparent; _inventio_ was one of the five canons of rhetoric, the others being _dispositio_, _elocutio_, _memoria_, _pronuntiatio_; inventio was strictly logical, as it concerned the collection and assessment of proof; understandably, since the other four prescribed the actual performance - and historical placement - of the speech, this one was the least connected to social reality]; translation becomes an __impoverished__ concept, only useful for the __creation__ of __new words__ (from __greek__; __lexical richness__, _copia_, is now the only quality of a text; _another problematic relationship, probably linked to the practice of exercitatio_), and indebted only to __grammar__, not rhetoric.

	- in general, translation as a __theoretical question__ disappeared alongside __greek__ in the west.

	- but roughly at the same time, __patristic texts__ were starting a strong tradition of __translation theory__; this had a __problematic connection__ with the latin tradition; patristic writing was modelling a __relationship with the scripture__; this meant that the purpose of __displacement__ and __appropriation__ used for __greek__ by the romans could not be extended to this field; patristic texts inherited the __loose__ - __literal__ dichotomy, without incorporating its contradictions.

	- the task of the translator was in this case to __restore__ the wholeness of revelation - a literal or loose rendition [jerome supported the latter] through which a __transcendent meaning__ has to emerge
