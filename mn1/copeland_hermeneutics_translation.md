#Rita Copeland - Rhetoric, Hermeneutics and Translation in the Middle Ages

- __Introduction__

	- the book intends to explore the relationship between __vernacular translation__ and the __language arts__; __translation__ should be placed between __hermeneutics__ and __rhetoric__ (__interpretation__ and __invention__).

	- its focus is that of __medieval critical practices__; but also on practices (and theories) of __translation__; as cicero defined them, the two poles were translation as "__interpreter__" and translation as "__orator__" (word by word or "creatively" _sense-for-sense_).

	- the crucial problem is the __overlapping__ of rhetoric and grammar, "__inventio__" (creative) and __enarratio__ (hermeneutical).

	- the background and the purpose of __medieval translation__ was often an __appropriation__ of __latin tradition__ - especially the __academic discourse__ [as we know from later sections of the book, this entailed a transference of _prestige_ and, possibly, _power_ - but not its elision].

	- tradition [possibly _translation_] was strictly connected to the __commentary tradition__, where commentaries often rewrote or __supplanted__ the "master" text.

	- the book is mostly focused on translations of __auctores__ (boethius and ovid), rather than "__popular__" translations like __lais__ or __romances__ [but might these observe the same set of principles?].

	- __copeland__ presents the __late antique__ developments of __translation theory__ between __rhetoric__ and __hermeneutic__; how some translations developed from - or supplanted - commentaries; how some translations (__primary__) were aligned with __interpretation__, while others (__secondary__) with __invention__; some were __interlingual__ (straight from the __latin__) and others __intralingual__ (considering __vernacular translations__ as a __source__), thus replacing the original text [in a hierarchical sense as well; a replacement of __auctoritas__]; the vernacular translation __displaces__ and __appropriates__ its materials through __exegesis__ and __invention__.
