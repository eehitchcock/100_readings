#Rita Copeland - Rhetoric, Hermeneutics and Translation in the Middle Ages

- __Introduction__

	- the book intends to explore the relationship between __vernacular translation__ and the __language arts__; __translation__ should be placed between __hermeneutics__ and __rhetoric__ (__interpretation__ and __invention__).

	- its focus is that of __medieval critical practices__; but also on practices (and theories) of __translation__; as cicero defined them, the two poles were translation as "__interpreter__" and translation as "__orator__" (word by word or "creatively" _sense-for-sense_).

	- the crucial problem is the __overlapping__ of rhetoric and grammar, "__inventio__" (creative) and __enarratio__ (hermeneutical).

	- the background and the purpose of __medieval translation__ was often an __appropriation__ of __latin tradition__ - especially the __academic discourse__ [as we know from later sections of the book, this entailed a transference of _prestige_ and, possibly, _power_ - but not its elision].

	- tradition [possibly _translation_] was strictly connected to the __commentary tradition__, where commentaries often rewrote or __supplanted__ the "master" text.

	- the book is mostly focused on translations of __auctores__ (boethius and ovid), rather than "__popular__" translations like __lais__ or __romances__ [but might these observe the same set of principles?].

	- __copeland__ presents the __late antique__ developments of __translation theory__ between __rhetoric__ and __hermeneutic__; how some translations developed from - or supplanted - commentaries; how some translations (__primary__) were aligned with __interpretation__, while others (__secondary__) with __invention__; some were __interlingual__ (straight from the __latin__) and others __intralingual__ (considering __vernacular translations__ as a __source__), thus replacing the original text [in a hierarchical sense as well; a replacement of __auctoritas__]; the vernacular translation __displaces__ and __appropriates__ its materials through __exegesis__ and __invention__.

1. _Roman theories of translation: the fusion of grammar and rhetoric_

	- medieval translation theory inherited from antiquity ideas like the contrast between "__literal__" and "__loose__" translations, but also broader issues - like __medieval translation__, latin translation had to __mediate__ between __rhetoric__ and __grammar__.

	- in __roman artes__, translation was linked with __literary imitation__ (from the standpoint of __rhetoric__) and __commentary__ (from the standpoint of __grammar__); it was also a __marginal issue__, often considered as little more than a school exercise; it became important with the __bilingualism__ of the empire and __hellenistic culture__, which implied a need for a transformation of __latin__ as well [that is, through the _exercitatio_ of translation, latin texts had to incorporate new terms and possibly new concepts; this produced an expansion and an enhanced flexibility of language].

	- __rhetoric__ included the study of the __ethical__ and __social__ aspects of language; grammar did not (rhetoric was __praxis__, grammar was __episteme__); but at times __hermeneutic__ could become a __praxis__ - at times its operation had to __incorporate__ the __circumstances__ of the interpreter (subject, audience, moment); at times __interpretation__ had to be rhetorical (an act of __linguistic creation__).

	- __translation__ and __imitation__ often overlapped; but translation aimed at __replacing the source__ (and the culture that produced it), while imitation was intended as an __organic continuation__ of a __project__ [and a broader tradition]; from the standpoint of __method__, this matched __inventio__ and __enarratio__ [this is a complicated step; does imitation correspond to inventio - the production of original content - or to enarratio - the expansion of a preexistent source? and what about translation? the problematic correspondence is probably part of copeland's argument], the boundary between passive hermeneutic and active creation (or rhetoric; __literal__ - __loose__); all ideas that reached the m. a. [i. e., middle ages].

2. _From antiquity to the middle ages 1: the place of translation and the value of hermeneutics_

	- the relationship between __rhetoric__ and __translation__ was transmitted to the __middle ages__ and the practices of __vernacular__ through __rhetorical compendia__ and __patristic writings__.

	- the __latin manuals__ of __late antiquity__ (iv s. c. e.) emphasized __inventio__ over the other parts of __ciceronian rhetoric__; the focus on __invention__ caused a separation of __rhetoric__ from its __social__ and __political__ relevance, from the needs of __praxis__ [the actual reason for this detachment is not entirely transparent; _inventio_ was one of the five canons of rhetoric, the others being _dispositio_, _elocutio_, _memoria_, _pronuntiatio_; inventio was strictly logical, as it concerned the collection and assessment of proof; understandably, since the other four prescribed the actual performance - and historical placement - of the speech, this one was the least connected to social reality]; translation becomes an __impoverished__ concept, only useful for the __creation__ of __new words__ (from __greek__; __lexical richness__, _copia_, is now the only quality of a text; _another problematic relationship, probably linked to the practice of exercitatio_), and indebted only to __grammar__, not rhetoric.

	- in general, translation as a __theoretical question__ disappeared alongside __greek__ in the west.

	- but roughly at the same time, __patristic texts__ were starting a strong tradition of __translation theory__; this had a __problematic connection__ with the latin tradition; patristic writing was modelling a __relationship with the scripture__; this meant that the purpose of __displacement__ and __appropriation__ used for __greek__ by the romans could not be extended to this field; patristic texts inherited the __loose__ - __literal__ dichotomy, without incorporating its contradictions.

	- the task of the translator was in this case to __restore__ the wholeness of revelation - a literal or loose rendition [jerome supported the latter] through which a __transcendent meaning__ has to emerge; for jerome a word-for-word translation may also imply an __obstacle__ to correct interpretation; the __implication__ is that the __transcendent meaning__ (signified) of __scripture__ will be delivered in any case, despite the potential variations in the particular __signifiers__ (__surface__ may vary, while __depth__ paradoxically remains the same); jerome repurposed the ciceronian precept of translating according to __sense__; boethius instrad defended literal translation.

	- around the __v s.__ (_nuptiis philologiae et mercurii_ by m. capella describes this), grammar and rhetoric were discussed again - __grammar__'s domain grew to include rhetorical figures; it had become the __main science of language and intepretation__ [substituting rhetoric]; "grammatical __enarratio__ comes to supplant rhetoric as the master discourse"; __hermeneutic supplanted rhetoric__.

3. _The rhetorical character of academic commentary_

	- __rhetoric__ was considered a __practical__ art [science] by __quintilian__ and the ensuing tradition; __enarratio__, a technique of __grammar__, slowly acquired the same __connotation__; at the same time, __commentaries__ and __enarrationes__ were incorporating some of the devices and ideas of __rhetorical composition__ (the __accessus__ ad _auctores_ is adapted from the _rhetorical circumstantiae_); commentary becomes an almost "__independent productive act__."

	- the focus of this __creative__ faculty was the __cur__ or the __causa__ of the __circumstantiae__ - it was the attempt to ascertain the author's __intentio__; another __creative mode__ was the __allegoresis__ (__commentary__ is an __allegorical translation__); paraphrase was, again, another form of __systematic interpretive translation__, between __rhetoric__ and __grammar__.

4. _Translation and Interlingual Commentary: Notker of St. Gall and the Ovide Moralisé_

	- __enarratio__ hand become a form of __rewriting__ that might occasionally __supplant__ the source text; together with __paraphrase__ we find __interlingual translation__; here copeland analyzes the history of the terms associated to exegesis - hermeneia and __interpretatio__; both were associated with __translation__, exegesis, and the __interpretation__ of __scripture__.

	- __vernacular translation__ was also linked to __exercitatio__, a form of rhetorical exercise aimed at enhancing the __flexibility__ of language.

	- copeland distinguishes between __two forms__ of __translation__ - "__primary__," that is __dependent__ from the __source__ and from the __tools__ of exegesis; and __secondary__, "independent textual productions" where __reinvention__ surpasses __exegesis__; here copeland provides two __contrasting__ examples (_apparently both of primary translations_): the __german translations__ of notker, which seem a predictable development of __interpretive practices__(primary); the __ovide moralisé__ [primary as well] uses the __same strategies__, but in an __implicit way__, to __replace__ the original and its function - the very auctor; the reader has become a (re)writer.

5. _Translation and intralingual reception: French and English Traditions of Boethius' "Consolatio"_

	- both notker and the ovide moralisé respond to the assumptions of __exercitatio__; the moralisé uses the techniques of __exegesis__ to incorporate __a commentary about itself__.

	- copeland likes to contrast a __metaphorical__ notion of __translation__ (a replacement __between distinct systems__) with a __metonymic one__ (a replacement __within the same system__); the translations of __boethius__ in __english__ and __french__ were indebted not only to the __latin source__ - but to themselves - each other; __vernacular languages__ became a __cluster__ of __autonomous relationships__, often with their own __authority__ [this is one of the cardinal sections of the book, and a resonant .

	- the practice of __exercitatio__ expanded not only the capabilities of a __vernacular__, but its __canon__ too; the new text produced in french and english could refer to these translations as __linguistic sources__ (__jean de meun__ refers to his own _boethius_ in the __roman de la rose__; chaucer uses his [jean de meun's] translation [into french] for his own [into english].


6. _From Antiquity to the Middle Ages 2: Rhetorical Invention as Hermeneutical Performance_

	- while some __translations__ existed as forms of __enarratio__, some __rhetorical inventions__ were, in fact, __translations__.

	- during the passage from __late antiquity__ to the __middle ages__, __inventio__ became an element of __dialectic__, no longer __rhetoric__; rhetoric lost its centrality, and remained useful only for __preaching__ - where __exegesis__ was more important than __invention__; __interpretation__ replaced __invention__; inventio became a science of reading - the discovery (this was its original meaning, in the context of __judicial rhetoric__) of __signa__ - __sense__; finding "__materia__ while reading.

7. _Translation as Rhetorical Invention: Chaucer and Gower_

	- __augustine__ and his tradition had __identified__ the __modus inveniendi__ with the __modus interpretandi__.

	- in this chapter copeland presents two examples of "__secondary__" translation - __chaucer__ and __gower__; here the __techniques of exegesis__ become techniques of __topical invention__; in these translations, vernacular is invested with the __prestige of academic discourse__ (while rhetoric is identified with __hermeneutics__); to introduce these problems, copeland provides a brief analysis of dante's "__de vulgari__" and "__convivio__," where the project is that of attributing to __rhetoric__ - and __vernacularity__ - the power of __exegesis__; through __exegetical performance__ (the deployment of the techniques of __exegesis__ and __commentary__), chaucer recovers __rhetoric__ as the instrument to make __translations__ displace their __source__; __confessio amantis__ uses __academic discourse__ and __auto exegesis__ for an __ethical project__; he shows a __fragmented world__ (_divisioun_) healed by an __interpretive process__ (_divisio textus_) in vernacular.

8. _Afterword_

	- in __roman antiquity__, __translation__ was a vehicle of the __conflict__ between __grammar__ and __rhetoric__, and __rome__ and __greece__; __medieval theory__ inherited some notions and techniques, but it also changed their function; sense-for-sense translation, for instance, was an __instrument__ of __appropriation__ and displacement for rome (cicero), and one of __conservation__ and submission to the source for christianity (jerome and the scripture).

	- in rome the dominant critical discourse was __rhetoric__; in the middle ages, it was hermeneutic.

	- vernacular translation is often a __transfer of privilege__ (cultural authority) from one sphere to another; it implies __appropriation__, not __access__.
