|Translation; Glosses; Appropriation|Baswell analyzes the sudden introduction of foreign languages in vernacular works, which he defines "languages of authenticity."|

- the linguistic scenario of england in the s. xiv and xv; while english was ascending, french remained important; french had to be taught, even to the upper classes; yet, it was still widely used.

	- french was an __arcane language__, especially for __law__; latin was still used for __devotional__, __academic__, and __diplomatic__ purposes.

	- Baswell considers the __sudden emergence__ of __foreign languages__ in __vernacular texts__ - languages that he calls "of __authenticity__"; he registers a shift from __authenticating french__ to __authenticating latin__.

	- after _kyng alisaunder_ and the _holkham bible_, baswell considers the _ellesmere ms._, where the use of latin in the glosses of ct would connect their reading to the canonical authors read in the classroom.

	- baswell concludes by emphasizing how the __linguistic irruptions__ are __unexpected__ or __inaccessible__ - they are "__virtual__"; obscurity made their impact on the page - it is a __foreign object__ that baswell ultimately defines "uncanny."
