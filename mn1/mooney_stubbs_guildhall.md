|Scribes, Trade, Political power|Mooney and Stubbs discovered that many of the scribes working in London at the beginning of the 15h Century were clerk attorneys hired at the London Guildhall, which might have contained a library of exemplars as well.|

- The several clerks of the Guildhall were in charge of recording and enacting the business of the mayor and the aldermen; the book then describes the various roles and functions.

	- the document employed to identify and follow the activity of the distinct clerks is the __liber albus__, a compilation of documents related to the government of the __city__.

- The clerks might have decided to devote time to literature because of special commissions, financial reasons, acquaintance with the writers, or the political mission of spreading english (__the dialect__) as the respectable vernacular of the country.
