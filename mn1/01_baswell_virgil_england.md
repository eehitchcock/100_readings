- The method is to look at _manuscripts_ as a __protean__ form; therefore, multilingualism and marginalia are crucially important.

- "Second, whatever his eloquence, Virgil told lies, about the gods and about history." (2)

- "Ambivalent rejection and reverence"

- The two books at the basis of the ladder in _Scalacronica_ exemplify this tension quite well: they are the _Bible_ and the _Troy_ book. __Duplicity__.

- Latin creates an inevitable connection to Virgil and his own language; vernacular allows for a new degree of creativity.

- Flexible boundary between __book__ (physical, individual - marginalia &tc.) and __text__ (abstract, omnipresent): it is not that apparent in the Middle Ages.

- Boundary can also rephrased as one between __codex__ and __auctor__. It is the _codex_ (the _bok_) that speaks.

- Flexibility of boundary also a flexibility of __language__.

- Three trends of virgilianism:

	1. allegorical;

	1. romance;

	1. pedagogical.

- Virgil as Shakespeare; Virgil as Freud (popular without being read; ideas that "escape" the immediate context of reading his works).

- Ambiguous reading of __Aeneas__ (occasionally a _traitor_ or a _negative_ figure) and of __Dido__ (what to make of her? cfr. _House of Fame_).
