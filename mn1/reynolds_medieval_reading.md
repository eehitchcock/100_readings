- Reynolds analyzes how the language arts shaped the teaching of Latin and the reception of classical literature; exegetical glosses were used to teach both __language__ and __ethics__; glosses to rhetorical figurs often caused a conflict between __rhetoric__ and __grammatica__.

1. _Introduction_

	- the purpose of the book is to establish the __historical features__ of the __reader__ [presumably the medieval reader; presumably these features concern his or her level of literacy, and the aim of the activity]; the __method__ consists in the analysis of __glosses__ - specifically __glosses__ to horace's __satires__ between __england__ and __france__, in the __xii__ s. - the crucial context of the __anglo-norman__ invasion and the __french renaissance__.

	- __grammatica__ was synonymous with __latin__ in this period; here too it contrasts __rhetoric__.

2. _Learning to Read: the Classics and the Curriculum_

	- in the later middle ages, learning to read meant learning to __read latin__; the first stage was __pronunciation__ (reading, reciting, and singing without understanding the meaning; _remember, of course, the prioress' tale_); then came learning the language - through the texts of the __auctores__; these were __instrumental__ to the learning of the language; horace's satires were pedagogical both for __language__ and __ethics__.

3. _Reading and the trivium arts_

	- "the __letter__ is the foundation of grammatica."

	- the parts of __language__ and the parts of __grammar__ are the same - __littera__, __syllaba__, __dictio__, __oratio__ ("dictio" is the word, "oratio" the phrase); all four stages are characterized by an __emphasis__ on __correctness__; but __rhetoric__ had a __prescriptive__ role as well.

	- the study of reading of the __auctores__ could shape or alter this notion of __correctness__ [auctores may have determined or challenged what is considered correct].

	- __reading__ the __auctores__ was, in grammar, a way to ascertain what __correct usage__ may be; in rhetoric, a way to "__produce discourse__"; __figurative language__ was a field claimed by __both sciences__; in fact, grammar and rhetoric slowly __converged__ between the __xii__ and __xiii__ s.; __enarratio__ was the practice where this happened most often.

	- __glosses__ help us understand the reader in this period; reynolds understands glosses as texts written "by experts for those who are not experts" (__pedagogical value__); she focuses on their __function__; glosses often offer paraphrase or synonyms; at times it provides background, or grammatical context.

##Part 2: Reading Practice

4. _Origins and Mythologies: the Invention of Language and Meaning_

	- here reynolds focuses on __linguistic etiology__ as a form of __mythology__; she first analyzes the myths concerning the __origins of language__; these also attempted to address the issue of __multiple languages__, and of __linguistic ambiguity__.

	- one of the solutions suggested was a __distinction__ between __significatio__ (apparently, the __referent__ or __signified__) and __nominatio__ (the __signifier__, more or less ambiguous depending on the _specificity of the_ context; _these two elements may probably also be understood as the processes of making either signified or signifier_); __grammatica__ is the __metalanguage__ used to __interpret__ these concepts; it focuses on __nominatio__.

5. _Reading Word by Word 1: The Role of the Vernacular_

	- in the imagination of xii s. writers, __latin__ and __grammatica__ were virtually __synonymous__, characterized by ideas of __order__, analogy, and system; __french__ and __english__, on the other hand, were systems of __disorder__ [consider copeland's reading of _divisoun_ and _divisio textus_], often in __competition__ with each other; the classroom was the space where these issues had to find a __practical answer__, starting with __precedence__ - should latin be taught using a __vernacular__ metalanguage?

	- __glosses__ to auctores were extensively used to __teach vocabulary__ - they were __translation glosses__ (interestingly, __food__, together with all the __household objects__, is always __translated__, as if it belonged to the __vernacular__ _that is, as if those concept belonged to the conceptual world of the vernacular; for other words a latin synonym was instead provided_); these glosses were "in the service of latinity"; __grammatica__ as a metalanguage was slowly translated into __vernacular__ [it was in itself translated from latin, or used for vernacular texts and linguistic structures].

6. _Reading Word by Word 2: Grammatical and Rhetorical Approaches_

	- __glosses__ would not only focus on __vocabulary__, but on __morphology__ and __syntax__ too, distinguishing __partes orationes__ for __significatio__ [primary or denotative meaning], __consignificatio__ [secondary or connotative meaning], and __ufficium__ (_the function of the term_; _the three subdivisions therefore being_ meaning; connotations; function); most grammatical glosses concerned verbs and nouns.

	- some glosses would provide __latin synonyms__ instead of __vernacular translations__; others explore the possible __derivations__ of a word, __constructing__ semantic trees through __etymology__; etymology was either __epistemological__ (to know more about the meaning of the word) or __rhetorical__ (to know more words related to it); some provided __mythological__ or __geographical__ background; some are __inventive__.

7. _From Words to the Phrase: The Problem of Syntax_

	- __syntax__ was a complex problem for medieval grammarians [as copeland explains, the concept was first explained while considering the __absolute ablative__]; for many it was hard to distinguish the __study of words-in-order__ [ordinatio] from that of __phrase construction__ (__oratio__); the __oratio__ as a concept was, in itself, hard to define [morphological boundaries, semantic boundaries]; some commentators even agree that __syntax__ and its study do not exist as objects of study; the second problem was whether syntax should be learned from __auctores__ or not; should these works determine __correctness__ in this field as well?

	- syntax glosses can be either __verbal__ (explaining rules of __concordance__ and __construction__) or __non-verbal__ (simply ordering words, or indicating relations between __distant terms__); the latter employed letters of the alphabet or a system of __strokes__, and was __widespread__ [insular and continental].

8. _Government: The Theory and Practice of a Grammatical Concept_

	- here reynolds explains __three relationships__ often emphasized by glosses: __congruitas__ (concordance in cases, persons, tenses); __determinatio__ and __regimen__ (which indicated [both] a __semantic__ and __grammatical__ [that is, morphological] relationship); __regimen__, in particular, was used for __oblique cases__ or transitive and intransitive links; these had to be taught to vernacular [speakers, both] kids [and youth].

9. _Rival Orders of Syntax: Vernacular, Natural, and Artificial_

	- __word order__ was one of the hardest skills to teach to vernacular speakers; but it was also one of the __principal obstacles__ found when reading a latin text, especially when authors modified the expected order imposed by either __custom__ [in latin; the "logical" and semantically expected arrangement] or analogy with the vernacular ("__ordo naturalis__," ambiguously __malleable__); this is one of the instances where the study of __auctores__ might contradict the prescriptions of grammatica.

10. _From the Phrase to the Text: Grammatical and Rhetorical Approaches Again_

	- the glossing of __tropes__ and __figures__ posed once again the problem of the __Boundaries__ between __grammar__ and __rhetoric__.

	- __barbarisms__ and __metaplasms__ were regarded as __deviations__ from the __linguistic norms__; auctores were exempt from them - they __defined the norm__ in their texts.

	- although glosses generally belong to __grammatica__, __figurative glosses__ concern __rhetoric__.


11. _Naked Intention: Satire and a New Kind of Literal Reading_

	- the chapter starts by reminding us of the __medieval__ definition of __allegoria__, a trope based on __difference__ - saying something by means of something else/different [__aliud__ is the key word in its definitions; _similitude and metaphore are, instead, based on analogy - by means of something similar_].

	- __allegoria__ usually comprehends __7 species__/kinds of tropes (including __antiphrasis__ [akin to ironia] and __paroemia__ - "a story applied to other times and subjects"); __satire__ is a problematic genre because it both __deploys__ and __subverts__ allegoria; allegoria works by __integumentum__ and __fabula__, satire by open and __naked speech__; the difference is __intention__.

12. _Literacy: A New Model for the Classical Text in the Middle Ages?_

	- here reynolds discusses the relationship between __pagan literature__ and __christianity__; pagan literature was used to teach latin [and textuality; it was therfore necessary to the teaching of scripture - its initial step].
