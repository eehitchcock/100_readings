#Medieval Grammar and Rhetoric - Rita Copeland and Ineke Sluiter

##Introduction

- the anthology contains books from __late latin antiquity__ to the __xv__ s.; __grammar and rhetoric__ were the fundamental __language disciplines__, essential to any kind of education; they were also the __starting point__ for every sort of __literary criticism__.

	- grammar and rhetoric were also more __inclusive__ than today; they were part of every __curriculum__, and therefore many of the texts theorizing about them were actually __pedagogical__ [they belonged to the classroom and its practices; these theories had therefore a concrete institutional importance, and a pedagogical purpose].

	- some of them were __widely known__; __donatus' ars minor__ [_crucial; it probably deserves some closer inspection_] was universally taught from 400 to 1400 (here are the __common grounds__ of european literature - anglo-mediterranean).

	- some of the text are concerned with the issue of __classification__; classification represented a sort of __epistemology__ rather than an actual __program of study__; they have diverse shapes [it is a constantly shifting system of definition, aimed at determining the role and methodological specificity of each discipline - in the present - rather than its actual role in a didactic project - in the future; _not entirely convinced of this_].

- aristotle's distinction between __theoretical__ and __practical__ knowledge reached the middle ages through __boethius'__ [consolation of] philosophy (and the pi and theta on her cloak, _standing for praxis and theoria_); the __stoics__ had a different classification of philosophy [_this should be briefly described_], whereas in the xii s. a new distinction, based on the books of aristotle's __orgnon__, was introduced by its arab commentators [_idem_]; finally, we had the system established around the __seven liberal arts__ - the __trivium__ (language) and __quadrivium__ (numbers _this section seems mostly concerned with the role of philosophy within the sciences in general, and not with its subdivisions_).

- the __classifications__ served the purpose of purpose of __mediating__ between __epistemology__ and __institutions__ [in themselves oscillating between theoria and praxis]; it was also a site of __meditation__ about the function and power of each knowledge, slowly changing [that is, according to a sort of hierarchy of disciplines, from the most to the least influential].

- the __classification__ of the arts also had an impact on representations of knowledge and cosmos.

- __grammar__ was the science of __language__ and __meaning__; it was instrumental to any other art; it had an important and __dynamic__ relationship with __logic__; the origin of grammar in the middle ages is found in the theories of the __stoa__, where logic was one of the three parts of philosophy [that is, grammar first reached the medieval system of disciplines through the tradition of _stoicism_].

- __grammar__ emerged not only from philosophical speculation, but from __literary analysis__ as well; it was both a science of __expressing__ and __understanding__; since words produced thoughts, grammar studied __how meaning is produced__ in general [presumably what reynolds defined as "nominatio"], and how ideas are communicated and remembered.

- __grammar__'s treatment of rhetorical figures was different from that of __rhetoric__ because grammarians considered them "faults" of style [_barbarism_ or _metaplasm_] - not __ornamentation__; they are __translations__ - transferences of meaning that are __intentional__ and __controlled__ (_this probably refers to rhetoric_; verbs of movement are used to describe their operation)
