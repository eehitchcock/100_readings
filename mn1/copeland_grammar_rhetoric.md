##Introduction

- the anthology contains books from __late latin antiquity__ to the __xv__ s.; __grammar and rhetoric__ were the fundamental __language disciplines__, essential to any kind of education; they were also the __starting point__ for every sort of __literary criticism__.

	- grammar and rhetoric were also more __inclusive__ than today; they were part of every __curriculum__, and therefore many of the texts theorizing about them were actually __pedagogical__ [they belonged to the classroom and its practices; these theories had therefore a concrete institutional importance, and a pedagogical purpose].

	- some of them were __widely known__; __donatus' ars minor__ [_crucial; it probably deserves some closer inspection_] was universally taught from 400 to 1400 (here are the __common grounds__ of european literature - anglo-mediterranean).

	- some of the text are concerned with the issue of __classification__; classification represented a sort of __epistemology__ rather than an actual __program of study__; they have diverse shapes [it is a constantly shifting system of definition, aimed at determining the role and methodological specificity of each discipline - in the present - rather than its actual role in a didactic project - in the future; _not entirely convinced of this_].

- aristotle's distinction between __theoretical__ and __practical__ knowledge reached the middle ages through __boethius'__ [consolation of] philosophy (and the pi and theta on her cloak, _standing for praxis and theoria_); the __stoics__ had a different classification of philosophy [_this should be briefly described_], whereas in the xii s. a new distinction, based on the books of aristotle's __orgnon__, was introduced by its arab commentators [_idem_]; finally, we had the system established around the __seven liberal arts__ - the __trivium__ (language) and __quadrivium__ (numbers _this section seems mostly concerned with the role of philosophy within the sciences in general, and not with its subdivisions_).

- the __classifications__ served the purpose of purpose of __mediating__ between __epistemology__ and __institutions__ [in themselves oscillating between theoria and praxis]; it was also a site of __meditation__ about the function and power of each knowledge, slowly changing [that is, according to a sort of hierarchy of disciplines, from the most to the least influential].

- the __classification__ of the arts also had an impact on representations of knowledge and cosmos.

- __grammar__ was the science of __language__ and __meaning__; it was instrumental to any other art; it had an important and __dynamic__ relationship with __logic__; the origin of grammar in the middle ages is found in the theories of the __stoa__, where logic was one of the three parts of philosophy [that is, grammar first reached the medieval system of disciplines through the tradition of _stoicism_].

- __grammar__ emerged not only from philosophical speculation, but from __literary analysis__ as well; it was both a science of __expressing__ and __understanding__; since words produced thoughts, grammar studied __how meaning is produced__ in general [presumably what reynolds defined as "nominatio"], and how ideas are communicated and remembered.

- __grammar__'s treatment of rhetorical figures was different from that of __rhetoric__ because grammarians considered them "faults" of style [_barbarism_ or _metaplasm_] - not __ornamentation__; they are __translations__ - transferences of meaning that are __intentional__ and __controlled__ (_this probably refers to rhetoric_; verbs of movement are used to describe their operation); they are a sort of __deviation__ too (but a deviation that is somehow inferrable from the original concept; _part of the same shape, the circle corresponding to a diameter - the number of significations allowed by a word_); figural and literal meaning are related before the deviation occurs (they are compared to the straight and curved elements of a circle); in later grammarians, the deviation of figure was extended to __fiction as a whole__ - a __distortion__ of truth (__fictio__ and __figura__ both come from __fingere__).

	- bede distinguished between __allegoria in verbis__ and __allegoria in factus__ (the first is __allegory__ strictu sensu, the second is __figura__ - _typology_); it remained a __complex__ distinction.

- [much of the focus of the book is on the distinction between the two - grammar and rhetoric; _we now know that this is a cardinal problem in the treatment of this topic_.] the two disciplines had to establish the __structure of composition__ as well; thew would serve as the principles for __poetical creation__; this structure often __mirrored__ ideas about __thoughts__ and __mental representations__ [that is, the structure of textual composition would match the structure of thought].

	- many images were recurrent for __poetic structure__ - the __house__, the __body__; another means to classify formal differences [classification and not metaphor, therefore] was the __literary genre__ (for instance __fabula__ - fiction - __argumentum__ - "realistic" fiction - and __historia__ - nonfiction; or "comedy, tragedy, invective, satire, fable, history, and argument"); these were used to frame broader questions of __ethics__ and __method__ [supposedly concerning the text itself; rhetoric studies the embodiment of language as _praxis_, in history and society].

- with augustine and christianity, the purpose of these disciplines shifts from __composition__ [rhetoric] to __hermeneutic__ [grammar] - they [the sciences of language] become the sciences of __interpretation__ of the __scripture__ (the text - fundamental - is _de doctrina christiana_); __invention__ and __interpretation__ merge - books are _written to be interpreted_ (here copeland cites the prologue from marie's lais, where she explains that the ancients wrote "oscurement" for us - _to be interpreted by us_).

- __ethics__ was remarkably not included among the __7 liberal arts__; __but__ it was the main teaching of the books that grammar regarded as its subjects; the science of interpretation allowed for the study of ethics (_it was its premise_); often this relationship was criticized or opposed (xiii s.; _probably with the introduction of aristotle's organon_).

##Part 1: Arts of Language Ca. 300 - Ca. 950

- introduction: the linguistic curriculum of the middle ages was inherited from __antiquity__; grammar was the subject that taught language [it was used to teach latin, and then language in general] and judged literature [it allowed readers to assess the value of works of literature].

	- donatus' __ars grammatica__ (_mid iv s ._, divided into _minor_ and _maior_) is the __key intermediary figure__ - he collected and organized a long tradition of __greek theory__ and __latin__ adaptations, in order to provide a __handbook__ for language analysis and poetical understanding.

	- donatus' work was highly influential, and originated many __subgenres__ - focused on grammar, figurative language, or christian readings.

	- priscian's __institutiones__ [v - vi s.] initially circulated only as a manual on __latin syntax__; it was rediscovered in the __x__ and in the __xii__ s. especially.

	- other fundamental books on the subject were the works of the __encyclopedists__ (e. g. _isidore_, _vi - vii s._) and the old works from __latin__ republican rome, the "__rhetorica ad herennium__" and cicero's _de inventione_ (both from __90 b. c.__); they contain the __universally__ renown __divisions of the speech__ (exordium, narratio, partitio [the presentation of both conversation and argument], confirmatio, refutatio [counterargument and response to it], peroratio).

	- the two approaches to __rhetoric__ were either highly _technical_ [praxis, we might assume] or _logical_ (dialectical, _theoria_); both ciceronian [that is, found in cicero]; cicero was the master of rhetoric up to 1100.

	- rhetoric and grammar shared the treatment of __tropes__; they were merged in the crucial work by augustine, __de doctrina christiana__ (397 - 426; _a turning point_).

##Part 2: Dossiers on the ablative absolute and etymology

- introduction: this section traces the development of the treatment of the __ablative absolute__ from late antiquity to the late xiv s.; from a simply grammatical interest, its discussion was included in __manuals of rhetoric__ (xii s.) and then in __debates__ on __dialectic__ (xiii) that attempted to define the relationship of __consequentia__ implicit in the connection [this might be the moment of _grammatica speculativa_; grammatica speculativa is that of the _modistae_; it contends that language makes meaning through three __modes__ - being, understanding, and signfiying - that correspond to both the __parts of speech__ and a representation of reality; for these thinkers, grammar was a way to access metaphysics]; __etymology__ was both a pedagogical tool (heuristic and mnemonic and, later, a precious method to analyze language.

- ablative absolute did not exist in greek; its treatment posed a problem for grammarians, since it required a step from the analysis of the __parts of speech__ to that of __syntax__ (a __combination__ of parts), a field that was still developing.

	- other commentators, like priscian, focus on the __meaning__ rather than the form of the construction; they inspire later philosophical approaches to the issue.

	- between __xii__ and __xiii__ we find two remarkable developments - a higher focus on priscian's __consequentia__ and the new notion of __regimen__ ("every term put in proper case, in a mutual relationship"; _as reynolds explains, however, this category was problematically oscillating between morphological and semantic description_), apparently defied by the ablative "__absolutus__" [without visible - morphological _and semantic_ - relationships]; in the __xiv__ we have __modi__ [probably the dialectical debate of grammatica speculativa].

- __etymology__ is a __speculative__ tool used to ground an argument on interpretation and tradition; its focus remains the __present__, not the __past__; it is a __causal connection__ explained by __similarity__.


##Part 3: Sciences and Curricula of Language in the XII s.

- the xii s. is the period of "__great systematic commentaries__ and __encyclopedic overviews__"; an __organization__ of __knowledge__ that is also an __epistemological meditation__ on its __structure__; this movement was probably prompted by the first __translation__ of __aristotle__ (and __plato__) from the __arabic learned texts__ (into latin, in the "great centers of southern europe"); the study of the __timaeus__ prompts an interest for __platonic cosmology__ and __natural philosophy__ (i. e. - __physics__).

	- this is also the moment when the great __cathedral schools__ of __rhineland__ and __northern france__ prosper (rhineland is western germany - french border); and the peak of activity in __toledo__, where greek, arabic, hebrew and latin learning intersected.
	
	- one __methodological change__ was the shift from __glosses__ to __independent commentaries__ in grammar and rhetoric books (priscian, donatus); they were __free standing commentaries__ with __short quotations__ ("lemmata") linking their contents to the original text; these commentaries allowed the reorganization and __subdivision__ of these disciplines (e.g. __grammar__ becoming independent from __logic__).
	
	- __rhetoric__ followed the same trajectory, with a renewed interest for __cicero__ and the __ad herennium__; it was caused by a wider interest in __primary sources__, in the malleability of __truth__, and in classical culture, logic and literature.
	
##Part 4: Pedagogies of Grammar and Rhetoric, ca. 1150 - 1280

- new __pedagogical needs__ caused the __combination__ of __ciceronian oratory__ [rhetoric] and __horace's poetic__ [poetic] under one umbrella - "grammatical __instruction__."

	- the twelfth century produced lasting changes in the __teaching of grammar__; the commentaries on priscian of the northern french schools focused on the __causes__ of __linguistic phenomena__ (accidents of the parts of speech) and the __theoretical__ (__philosophical__) aspects of language; the same for __rhetoric__ (__ethically__ and __epistemologically__ considered).

	- this philosophical change met some __new educative needs__; now latin had to be taught to speakers of vernacular; and latin itself had changed; the new popular __handbooks__ (_alexandre of villa dei_ and _eberhard of béthune_) were __in verse__, to aid __memorization__, and they depended on priscian and donatus; but they addressed only __exposition__, not the __composition__ of __whole texts__; __composition__ was __prescribed__, for instance, in the __commentaries__ to horace's __ars poetica__, and in the many "__arts of poetry__" inspired by it (the most influential one was the "__poetria nuova__" by __geoffrey of vinsauf__, in verse); these __manuals__ combined __pragmatic grammar__ and __pragmatic rhetoric__, horace and cicero, figures and versification, __interpretation__ and __invention__; they explain and present a __classical canon__; they were used both in __elementary__ schools and in __universities__.
	
	- alongside these texts we find __artes dictaminis__ (letters) and __predicandi__ (teaching).
	
##Part 5: Professional, Civic, and Scholastic Approaches to the Language Arts - Ca. 1225 - Ca. 1272

- the __pedagogical project__ of the xii s. was __comprehensive integration__ of disciplines; that of the __xiii__ was __specialization__; universities were organized in __faculties__ where __disciplinary distinctions__ were crucial, and defined sharply; and sharp distinctions marked the approaches of __different schools__ as well (__paris__ emphasized __theoretical knowledge__ and __logic__; __bologna__ was dominated by __law__).

	- __ars dictaminis__ began in __italy__; it was a development of __rhetoric__ aimed at the composition of __prose letters__, for __bureaucratic__ reasons; among its centers we find __bologna__; it slowly replaced __classical rhetoric__ in some contexts.
	
	- in __oxford__ and in __paris__, during the xiii s., priscianus and donatus were still read regularly, but for __theoretical__ - not __linguistic__ - reasons; it was an __introduction__ to __linguistics__ and semantics, subordinated to __logic__; language was a premise to logic, and latin was its scientific language; language was now investigated as an __epistemological problem__, a turn that led to the __modistae__ of the late xiii s. (who classified __linguistic components__ and rules under the "mode of signifying," separated from the ontological "mode of being" and the rational "mode of understanding"); __syntax__ poses another __theoretical problem__.

	- more concrete and __traditional__ approaches to grammar (based, e.g., on the __canon__ of acutores) survived in grammar schools [outside of universities].

	- the role of rhetoric in universities during the xiii s. is debated; it developed as "__vernacular ciceronianism__" in italy, in the 1260s, as an aid in __dictaminal__ classes; but the greatest change occurred with the introduction of aristotle's __rhetoric__ in the latin west; the system of the __organon__ considered rhetoric as a specific science, with strong __ethical__ and __political__ ripercussions.

##Part 6: Receptions of the Traditions; the Language Arts and Poetics in the later M. A. (ca. 1369 - ca. 1475)

- vernacular handbooks still presented many elements of __continuity__ with ancient language __arts__; latin was still taught and regulated through donatus, priscianus, villa dei, and béthune.

	- grammar and logic were inextricably bound up - this was the peak of __speculative grammar__ (late xiv s.); in the __xiv s.__ the philosophical discussions of grammar reached its teaching outside of universities (modi and speculative grammar); __scholastic__ ideas were used in grammar schools.

	- the metalanguage of __latin__ grammar was increasingly deployed for __vernaculars__.

	- in rhetoric, the __ad herennium__ re-emerged.
