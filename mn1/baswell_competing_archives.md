|Multilingualism; Translation; Compilation|The essays in this cluster complicate notions of "monoglot nationhood," "vernacular," "mother tongue," and "archive," here potentially a single manuscript.|

- In the late middle ages, anglo-norman, latin, and english seemed to coexist and be somehow __mutually intellegible__. What these studies reveal is the __untenability__ of ideas of "monoglot nationhood" and hierarchies of language; these mss., and the culture that produced them, were unstably __multilingual__.

	- Baswell suggests that vernacular should be a multilingual referent; it does not refer necessarily to a single tongue, nor to European languages in general; vernacular should be understood as the __most comfortably used language__ or dense lexis of a particular local setting. 

	- there might be different mother tongues for different disciplines or social interactions; latin was, for cannon, the "mother tongue for literacy."

	- baswell also extends the notion of __archive__ to the __multilingual mss.__ analyzed by these authors; they are objects of both __reading__ and __performance__ (flexible use).
