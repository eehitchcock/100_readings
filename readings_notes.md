#Notes - August 19th 2015

##To-do list

1. Get started on all four lists; nothing will give you a better sense of what's next than some careful hands-on work.
2. Contact the four advisors (next week?) to define a schedule for the first few meetings.
3. Decide on an effective, convenient system for annotations and end-notes. Understand how many texts would be available right noow; how many should be bought; how many could simply be printed out.
  - Ideally, we should be able to combine bot; we should have a _hard-copy_ for each single text, and a digital system of annotations to accompany it. We know very well that that would be the perfect combination.
