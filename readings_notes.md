#Notes - August 19th 2015

##To-do list

1. Get started on all four lists; nothing will give you a better sense of what's next than some careful hands-on work.
2. Contact the four advisors (next week?) to define a schedule for the first few meetings.
3. Decide on an effective, convenient system for annotations and end-notes. Understand how many texts would be available right noow; how many should be bought; how many could simply be printed out.
  - Ideally, we should be able to combine bot; we should have a _hard-copy_ for each single text, and a digital system of annotations to accompany it. We know very well that that would be the perfect combination.
  - Also, we should keep in mind that some texts __won't__ be available on-line; the perfect examples are _Copeland's_ anthology, and every facsimile that we will be using for the first MN list.
  - For this last point, therefore, we should find a better, more versatile system.
  - For now, we will try using a single .md file for each text, as we had initially planned.
