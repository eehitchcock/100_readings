#Aesthetic theology and its enemies - David Nirenberg

##Introduction

- the __axial age__ [term coined by karl jaspers to refer to the centuries going from viii to iii s. b. c.] is the era when humanity discovers religion and transcendence; its main components are __skepticism__ - the knowledge that __human senses__ are __limited__ and __transient__ - and __transcendent__ [thought] - the belief that truth exists truth exists __beyond__ the mortal world.

	- for thinkers like __plato__, the __human being__ is __split__ between these two realms - eternity and temporality, transcendence and immanence; the human soul would be eternal; the body only a fleeting - and __deceiving__ - vessel.

	- __christianity__ has affinities with platonism [it is important to remember, however, that - according to prof. velasco - neoplatonism ended with john of salisbury, between canterbury and __chartres__ - the last center of neoplatonic philosophy - in 1180]; its goal is often __skepticism__ in the mortal world, and __faith__ in the transcendent one.

	- the example quoted by __nirenberg__ is related to __food__ - it is found in luke 12:1-2, and it concerns __bread and yeast__, both understood once __figuratively__, and once __literally__ (what is the __yeast__? _this question still requires an answer; jesus, in fact, does not provide a satisfactory equivalent for this signifier; we are left, like the apostles, without a precise answer_); the apostles here were distracted by __hunger__; nirenberg claims that the same confusion surrounds __judaism__ - literally a religion, and symbolically a __lack of understanding__ - an erroneous interpretive disposition (those who could / cannot understand; _the idea resonates with almost every anti-semitic text produced in england since s. xiii, including chaucer and perhaps the merchant of venice_).

	- the thesis of the book is that __christian culture__ has been shaped by its perception of the "jew."

	- nirenberg describes how hellenism, propagated by alexander's army, was a system of transcendent thought; when it reached the jewish world, which was also a transcendent world, jewish intellectuals, like philo [of alexandria, a contemporary of jesus; _he used philosophical allegory to harmonize greek philosophy and jewish religion; in a way, a predecessor of maimonides_], appropriated that method and vocabulary to study the interpretation of the bible.

	- later, paul transformed the __religious difference__ between jews and christians into __aesthetic differences__ [in perception and interpretation]
