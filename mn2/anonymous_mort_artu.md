50. Many knights have died in their search for the grail [__dialogue is more detailed__ here; pace is __slower__]; the focus is now on __lancelot__ and __guinevere__. lancelot fights at a tournament; gawain discovers that he was fighting for a woman other than guinevere [the style is that of a novel; the __literal meaning__ is what matters most].

	- [one could say that the more physical concern of the _mort artur_, which is actually a telling of lancelot's affair with guinevere and its consequences, is to chretien's _lancelot_ what _quest_ is to _perceval_; one is a concealed allegory, where the literal level is somehow untouched, the second is an open allegory, where the interpretation of the narrative is extended to the reader]

	- we find a __trial__ for guineviere's fidelity, concerning a __sign__ (a __poisoned apple__ that guineviere gives to the wrong knight); lancelot and gueneviere's love cause arthur's death.
