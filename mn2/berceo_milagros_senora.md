##Idea

- These miracles contain the __remarkable__ introduction where the poet contrasts the __bark__ and the __core__.

- The __miracle__ is the _fiction_ that can become true through a __trial__.

##Introduction

- gonzalo was born around 1196 in berceo (north-east of spain); he became a clerk, then a deacon; he would, therefore, be an ideal representative of the _mester de clerecía_.

- the poems of the milagros all have __latin antecedents__ - with the exception of the "iglesia robada," possibly his addition; the genre is that of __hagiography__ [not quite; the narrative focus shifts too much], combined with __exempla__ [more likely; the book has more affinities with marie de france or chaucer than with a canonical hagiographical book].

- gonzalo introduced __liveliness__ and __dialogue__ in his version of the collection [paradoxical realism, given that the emphasis is on allegorical events; the __dialogue__ is the __debate around interpretation__ of __signs__, which occasionally becomes legal and public; the __liveliness__ is the most problematic layer; it seems to distract us from the allegorical _core_ of the collected stories - but perhaps it is instead a way to extend the domain of allegory to every aspect of human life - to make us realize that mortal temporality, _immanence_, is the allegory of immortal eternity, _transcendence_].

- among the possible reasons for the composition of the work, we find the __entertainment__ of the __pilgrims__ who travelled through the convent where gonzalo worked; he becomes the main character of the __introduction__, which he probably invented [and where he plays the role of the _reader_ and _interpreter_ of his own vision, modelling the reception of his book]; __typology__ is one of his most recurrent devices, aligning the old and the new testament, and perhaps suggesting their persistence [of these transcendent elements through time] in the present.

- the work ends with a __philological mystery__ - the __order__ of the last two episodes [teófilo and the "iglesia robada," the first one highly literary, the second almost a chronicle] is highly debated.


##Comment

46. as the introduction begins, berceo himself describes his discovery of the __definitive locus amoenus__ [during a pilgrimage], a __terrestrial paradise__ of sweet fruits and pleasantries; but then he stops the description to "remove the bark" of his poetry - the pilgrimage is life, the garden found at its end is the hereafter [berceo immediately __breaks the allegory__, removing the literal meaning to describe its __figurative core__, the system of correspondences between his narrative and that of salvation]; every element of the garden has a __figurative meaning__ - the four springs are the gospels, the shadows are prayers, and so on; gonzalo eventually describes himself __literally__ [or/and figuratively?] writing her miracles in verses, in this garden [the metaphorical world is therefore __restored__ - _and for the rest of the collection_, the allegory persistent through this art; _somehow an ambiguity remain, as if we did not know precisely on which side of the boundary we are; where do we locate gonzalo himself, where do we locate his very process of writing? perhaps he is asking us not to solve this doubt, but to keep living in doubt_]

141. the first miracle concerns a __good bishop__ rewarded for his services to mary - including a book written for her [and here the alignment with berceo is obvious, especially since we have just read about him writing; we are therefore reading about him writing about somebody writing about mary; mary is activating this chain of sequential referents, this mise en abyme of signifiers signifying] - and his bad successor, strangled by the same chausible [robe for clergy] inherited from the good man [a physical object animated by divine justice; becoming a signifier for marian providence]; mary dispensed __justice__ [another crucial term] through her gifts [an embodiment of providence].

	- this justice operates in the __afterlife__ as well, as the second miracle, concerning a monk's soul, relates; the monk dies after having committed a sin [he is drowning in a river which, for prof. velasco, represents the boundary between transcendence and immanence, and therefore between secondary and literal meaning; the river of interpretation, where the monk plunges together with the reader; death is somehow the permanent activation of a secondary meaning, the decortication of the allegorical bark; this is where interpretation - divine interpretation, in the form of a legal disputation - occurs], but mary intercedes for him, explaining that the monk was still devoted to her [and that he showed his devotion through a living sign, his bowing to her statue every day]; it is a legal disputation, a trial resolved by god, who sends the soul back to the monk's body [a return to the literal, immanent world of signifiers; a motion similar to the return into the garden of the introduction, once meanings have been revealed, and we dwell in a state of heightened hermeneutic attention, of awareness - we now know that there is a hidden system of correspondences governing the visible world; this state is a degree of sanctity, as the virtuous monk demonstrates].

	- the third miracle occurs entirely after the death of its protagonist, whose body [a sign, activated in the afterlife] is moved to a decent resting place, and whose mouth grows a beautiful flower [emergence of the secondary layer]; this too was a clerk.

	- the fourth miracle is based on a __misunderstanding__ - a dying clerk is promised immediate relief [from the pain afflicting him]; but instead of healing, he dies; the __lack of correct interpretation__ is thematized even earlier, when he mistakes five wounds with five senses [_his prayer consisted of an appeal to the five "gozos" of mary; these "gozos" were both the wounds of christ and the senses of man; again, signifiers and signifieds need to coexist in the process, like body and soul_; __dialogue__ is a way to address __textual interpretation__ as a __circumstance__ where we can read __miracles__, like reality itself].

	- the fifth miracle is a __public death__ [entirely legible? openly debatable? a collective revelation of the secondary world?].

351. in the sixth, mary saves a thief who had been devoted to her, by preventing his __execution__ [the favor towards the guilty therefore becomes, again, publicly legible; a miracle is this sudden collective revelation].

	- on the other hand, the protagonist of the seventh is an __irreligious monk__ [__complex__, unpredictable social world; the __ethical__ and __transcendent__ order of religion does not correspond to what we see and assume here, to the structure and expectations of society - in fact, religion can be its __radical inversion__; _that is, sinners can be holy, and holy men be sinners; signifiers at times conceal unexpected signifieds; miracles are also a lesson in skepticism; in most cases, however, the meaning is universal salvation_], who is, however __resuscitated__ [these resurrections are rebirths in a state of allegorical awareness, hermeneutic baptisms, sudden bursts of lucidity] after death, thanks to mary's intercession.

	- the eighth has its main character falling for one of the devil's tricks - disguised as an angel [problematic interpretation; some signifiers require more attention, and their understanding is especially counter-intuitive], he convinces him that he will be redeemed by cutting off his own genitals; he does so, and dies; this prompts another trial in the hereafter, where santiago [the man was a pilgrim, although a fornicator], with mary's help, proves that his action was not a __suicide__, and resuscitates him - safe and sound, although deprived of his genitals (therefore more holy).

	- the ninth is about the clergy, and the reward due to a monotonous priest [he would always recite the same mass, the same prayer], who was, however, devout to the virgin.

	- the tenth is the miraculous redemption and resurrection of an inveterate sinner [a greedy man], who had been scorned even by saints while he was living [here we have an inversion of our earthly expectations regarding salvation, and a legal disputation involving a strategic plea to the right saint].

	- the eleventh is another unexpected salvation; the twelfth is a miraculous voice, uttered from the afterlife by a dead prior; the thirteenth is mary's voice, appointing a bishop from heaven; the fourteenth is a painting of mary which survives from a fire [these are all signs - signifiers - appearing from beyond; they contrast with the counterintuitive or problematic episodes of the previous section]; in the fifteenth one mary appears to a former clerk to preserve his virginity, and hides him from the bride [the clerk disappears from the social world, to avoid the engagement and remain holy; as if he had crossed the boundary introduced in the second miracle, becoming an entirely _signified_ creature].

582. in the sixteenth, a jewish child who wants to convert [impressed by the liturgy and iconography experienced in church during the communion] survives being thrown into an oven, while his father burns alive [again, mary as an embodiment of __providence__]; the seventeenth reiterates the notion by presenting the case of three knights __condemned__ [to experience divine suffering], then redeemed [having accessed the level of hermeneutic lucidity]; the eighteenth is again antisemitic, with mary's voice revealing the obscure restaging of the crucifixion [using a mannequin of jesus on the cross, a bizzarre attempt at crafting a system of symbols equivalent to the allegorical correspondences of these miracles] enacted by a rabbi and his followers; the nineteenth is even more public, and occurs on a ship, where a pregnant woman is saved from drowning [here mary is also the protectress of pregnancy; pregnancy - the reverse of death - could be another moment where the boundary between immanence and transcendence, secondary and literal, grows thinner].

	- the twentieth is about interpreting reality - a drunken monk meets the devil many times, in the shape of diverse animals [an echo of the tetramorphs discussed by maimonides] - a bull, a dog, a lion. he is saved by a careful mary [he __experiences an actual allegory__, sins embodied by animals; _an exemplary miracle, whose significance could be expanded to the rest of the collection_].

	- the twenty-first miracle is longer than all which came beforel it is about a prioress fallen into sin (she's either pregnant or - __figuratively?__ afflicted by the poison of a herb), and rescued by mary, who removes every visible __symptom__ [sign, _signifier_; _reality - the reality expressed by these signifiers - becomes independent from the signifiers; the lady remains pregnant, although she does not seem pregnant, although the signifiers of pregnancy have been removed from her_]; the miracle is even attested by a thorough examination performed by a zealous, mean bishop; the child lives on [and he becomes a holy man, worthier than the ones who were going to punish his mother; pregnancy, like death, prompts a new life in lucidity].

702. in the twenty-second [highly allegorical?] a pilgrim who was travelling by ship is saved from drowning.

	- the protagonist of the twenty-trhird is a merchant, who gets a loan from a jewish lender; this is convinced [of the merchant's integrity] only by the christian __signs__ found in a church (a painting) and uttered by a __miraculous crucifix__; these signs, which include the __materialization of money__ [signs constitute an economy, and function according to predictable rules; but divinity is the systematic breaking of these rules, the introduction of odd currencies, the violation of the market], prompt the jew to convert.

911. the twenty-fourth is the story of "teófilo," a potentially self-standing episode; it has more antisemitic content, and the temptations of a devil; the protagonist eventually makes a __deal__ with him [to obtain money and public approval, coinciding with a position in the clergy], and for this reason loses his shadow [a small signifier]; he repents, after having suffered the painful signs sent by god [infirmity]; mary saves him, but he has to publicly repent, showing the __contract__ [the letter signed by him and the devil] to the bishop and the people [another sign, this time written]; he is eventually saved, both in earth and in heaven; this triumphal episode is followed by a small and __local__ one [the twenty-fifth, "iglesia robada," possibly a later addition, invented by berceo], about thieves punished by mary.
