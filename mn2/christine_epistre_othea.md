##Ideas

- At times the book seems to adapt almost perfectly to the principle and the metaphor first introduced by Hugh of Saint Victor - the idea that allegory uses different stories - blocks of different stories - to build familiar objects.

##Introduction

- the biographical sketch insists on her __economic difficulties__ as a __widow__ and as an __orphan__; three children, an old mother and a niece; trials and a __contended inheritance__.

	- before the epistre, christine had mostly written poetry - often __love lyrics__; the epistre is her first __grave book__ - the first "__serious__" one; it is a letter sent by the goddess othea to hector, as a __pedagogical tool__ [it is, therefore, also a reflection on what a pedagogical tool should be like; _it is a pedagogy, an attempt at a new way of doing pedagogy_].
	
	- each text of the hundred ones constituting the whole work is an __example__ for the youth - a __poem__ followed by a __gloss__ and an __allegory__ [the youth is asked to practice his discernment as he reads the _exempla_; some of them are positive examples, other are negatives; some seem negative in the gloss, and become positive in the allegory; it is an exercise in skepticism]; the __short example__ __mentions__ a __canonical episode__; the gloss expounds it by providing a __moral introduction__ for the miles - the knight; the allegory presents the __transcendent implications__; the structure is __extremely rigid__.
	
	- the model is that of the __vita nova__, where dante had applied __biblical exegesis__ to his own works; the application to a __letter__, an "epistre," is in any case surprising.
	
	- othea is not an actual __greek deity__ - possibly christine's own __invention__.
	
	- among the sources, we find the __ovide moralisé__ [s. xiv, _same way of interpreting the mythological world of greek religion from a christian and ethical perspective_].
	
	- __lbm harley 4431__; __bodley 421__; and __paris 606__ all contain the same cycle of images (101); some of these images seem to have been accompanied by explanations written by christine herself; they __complement the text with new details__ [figurative elements not mentioned in any part of the text].
	
##Commentary

0. the first page of harley 4431 dedicated to the text shows __christine herself__, handing a codex to what is supposedly a __young aristocrat__ in a courtly setting; the woman and the youth exchange glances.

	- the poem starts by addressing an anonymous "haulte flour" - creating ambiguity - for a moment we may think that christine herself is writing [she is], outside the narrative frame, to salute an actual recipient [she is]; she is simply praising a flower/person - young, beautiful, strong; but the __ground of the metaphor__ is then reduced to __two distinct tenors__ - the son of charles v and hector [and this is what metaphor does - it multiplies potential referents, it creates multiple valid interpretations]; the voice becomes again that of christine, willing to use her humble knowledge for a good cause - the __education of a ruler__.
	
	- the first caption then explains that othea is the goddess of __knowledge__, and that every time that a character is "__en nues__," the intention is to signify - "__c'est a entendre__" - that we are looking at gods and goddesses [the rubric is therefore establishing a __different set of correspondences__, another __language__ where signifiers systematically correspond to signifieds].
	
	- the young aristocrat identified with hector is similar to, but not identical, to the actual recipient of the book [in the illumination, that is; their clothing and appearance evoke continuity, but not identity]; the image with othea __inverts__ the structure of that with christine [a different syntactic arrangement of the same signs] - the goddess is in the upper left, the youth is in the lower right; hector is visibly smaller than his courtisans [a difference from the recipient of the book]; he is carrying a __hawk__, while __a golden shield__ is hanging from the tree on top of which the goddess appears [all these signs are not mentioned by the gloss or the allegory; having established the first few correspondences of this language, the book tests our capacity to find and to define new ones, by creating rich and potentially polysemous visual arrangements]. the letter itself is in a __white sheet__ with a __red symbol__ on - perhaps a seal [another unexplained detail].
	
	- the courtisans are bemused [in the image; the young hector seems instead confident and aware].
	
1. the letter starts by introducing the sender and praising the recipient [both fictional now; but the circumstance mirrors the opening of the book itself - again a _figura_], a youth destined to become a warrior - the son of mars and minerva [allegorically; hector was not their son in the myth]; the pedagogical purpose is to train his __heart__, and to make him long for "__pegasus__," "_le cheval que par l'air s'en voles_" [a surprising metaphor; pegasus is the means to fly to the heavens, not the destination]; the __pedagogical language__ combines __learning and love__, an __affective__ and __intellectual__ elevation; she will teach him because he loves her.

	- the glosse explains that othea means "sagece de femme"; it justifies the __circumstance historically__ - the greeks were pagans; they often called __especially virtuous women__ goddesses; one of these goddesses favored the young hector [the circumstance may, of course, be applied to christine and her recipient; in this case, therefore, the book is the allegory of the circumstances when it was written].
	
	- the __allegorie__ is explained as the application of "__la sainte escripture a nos dis__"; a work of __collation__ and __integration__; the premise is always "__milita est vita hominis__" [from the book of __job__, in the latin __vulgata__]; the actual allegory explains that __prudence__ is the most important __virtue__ for a knight, and it cites __augustine__.
	
10. the second image shows a __goddess__ and a __clock__ - __temperance__; she is regulating the clock, like reason has to regulate the __human body__; a group of __women__ watches her, lying on the ground beneath.

	- the poem only __mentions__ temperance, described as othea's sister; the glose explains why they are called sisters, and quotes from __democritus__; the allegorie explains __temperance__ by quoting agugustine - and by referring to the __control__ of __carnal wishes__, thus referring to both __image and caption__ [differently from the rest of the text].
	
	- no caption accompanies the following image, where hercules, holding a club and standing on a slain dragon, is facing two lions; the poem describes __force__, and how the youth can admire it in hercules without seeking supernatural battles - there are wars enough "en terre," like the animals fought by the hero [earthly signifiers for unearthly strength; the natural world stands for the supernatural one; lions and dragons are equally extraordinary] - "force" can be used to resist their attacks; the glosse explains that this force is not only __physical__, but also __constance__ and __fortitude__ - then it explains who hercules was; the allegorie uses john and ambrose to turn strength into the constance of virtue, a requisite for a virtuous soul.
	
	- minos is the example of a __just ruler__; in the picture he holds a club as well; the gloss explains that a good ruler judges not only the others, but himself and his behavior; the allegory applies it to the __intimacy of a soul__ (in general, the gloss __expands__, while the allegory moves __inward__; the gloss is __ethical and social__, historically detailed; the allegory is __spiritual, personal, intimate__).
	
	- perseus is holding a scythe in the - __beautifully dynamic__ - illumination; the poem turns him into a "bon chevalier errans" [from the tradition of __romance__], protecting andromada from a "belue"; in the glosse, christine refers explicitly to the __scythe__, explaining that it implies that the hero killed many men in battle - the rest of the gloss provides more context - __literal__ - and __generalizes__ the exemplum; the allegorie turns andromeda into a __freed soul__, and the horse into an angel, making the episode a lesson on __good fame__ (__violence__ is turned into a __sign for change__ - __historical and moral__; __violence redeemed by allegory__; violence signifying those actions that occur outside of allegory).
	
	- the image of jupiter requires a caption explaining the circles of the planets, corresponding to the astrological influences and the ancient gods; the caption explains his two gestures too - the hand and the dew sprinkled on earth; the poem briefly refers to jove and his attributes; having provided some historical detail, the gloss explains that jove is a jovial god, a cheerful ruler; for the allegory, this __joviality__ is __charity__ [here we have an example where the interpretation takes the shape of a sequence of translations, from the image, to its moral expansion, to its allegorical interpretation, each step requiring the previous one].
	
	- the following __illumination__, venus, is depicted with lovers presenting - or concealing - their hearts; the poem and the gloss dissuade the youth from obeying to her; the allegory turns her into __vanity__.
	
	- captions seem to precede every god; saturn is a __wise old man__, sitting above a group of sad, wise, old and learned men; poem, gloss, and allegory seem to develop a __single meditation__ here, turning __wisdom__ into __insight__ [from social expansion to interior understanding, the move remains the same].
	
	- apollo is truth in the gloss, and the __word__ [the gospel, the word of christ] in the allegory [he is depicted as the sun in the illumination].
	
	- the moon is the cause of __melancholy and folly__, and it should be avoided.
	
30. the work is a __gallery__, constantly expanding from the illumination - which prompts a reading in itself, an initial __hermeneutic attempt__ [curiosity], supported by the precedence of the caption over the rest - the first text being a __translation__ from the image; the first sign is a __vision__, shared by reader and writer.

	- mars is depicted above a battlefield; an armed youth; the __relationship between god and men__, watching each other, affecting each other, and __informing each other__, may parallel that of __author and writer__ (othea is christine; _perhaps author and reader too_); in the allegory, he [mars] becomes christ.
	
	- mercurius is a wise scholar, over a group of wise scholars talking; for christine, he is the good of __good language__ - the interpretation shapes his presentation [that is, the illumination already presents enough visual clues to let the reader understand the way in which the character ought to be read].
	
	- minerva's weapons become __faith__ in the allegory; in the image, she is seen offering weapons to her knights, from the sky; the image is the __allegorical personification of faith__ [it does not represent minerva]; the poem and the gloss call her minerva [but she does not need to be her].
	
	- pallas and minerva, two and the same, oversee an encounter between clerks and knights [the multiple denominations of the same goddess stand for the multiple ways in which social classes perform their duties for the same purpose; two signifiers, one signified; two roles, one goal; allegory is here an instrument of social cohesion].
	
	- after the series of saints [and gods], othea lists exempla of virtuous warriors; the poem mentions briefly, the gloss expands, and the allegory translates into theological ideas (i. e.: pantasilea is "charity).
	
	- the poems and the glosses ask the reader to either __imitate or repel__ each exemplum; virtues are alternated with vices; at times the poem seems to become a __concise caption__ for the illumination - memorable and pleasant; this section (16-22) seems to deal with the __capital sins__ (and christine seems to have little interest in __gluttony__, _which here coincides entirely with drunkenness_).
	
	- the form becomes __progressively standardized__; the poem is divided into __segments of four lines__; the glossed is a __detailed exposition of the myth__ [a short narrative, like the ones found in the cité des dames], with a small conclusive moral; and the __allegory__ uses terminology and quotation from the scriptures or the patrologia.
	
	- the following section associates __goddesses__ to __cosmological elements__, and both to the articles of the __christian creed__, read in order; the goddesses then incorporate mythological figures, for those sections of the creed concerning the earthly passion of christ (here the allegory, the text of the creed, seems to be the leading structural element); the relationship is at times almost __typological__ (e.g. - midas figura of pilate); at times very subtle, __marginal__.
	
60. some moves are __intellectually stimulating__; the last article of the creed, about the __resurrection of flesh__ into __eternal life__, is matched with an image of __pagan death in despair__ - __atropos__, the old fate putting an end to mortal life; it is a __contrast__, not a __parallel__.

	- the following section is about the __commandments__ - christine explicitly states that the episodes told in the poem and the gloss (or the images) are the __allegory__ of the religious content [inversion of the expected order].
	
	- the allegorical connections of this section are usually __unexpected, jarring__ - the "do not kill" commandment is matched with __medicine__; medicine itself is described [doubled] in a __positive example__ - esculapius' science - __and a negative__ - circes - both depicted in the same image and series of lines.
	
	- the exercise of allegorical connection seems at times a purely __verbal one__, a __rhetorical connection__, an __exercise in masonry__ [rhetorical ability to find unexpected verbal connections between ideas].
	
	- the following section seems to have __no structural principle__; the episodes told are matched with __theological elements__, or __teachings__.
	
	- the characters depicted in the stories maintain the same physical traits, so that they can be recognized throughout the book, perhaps establishing __new interpretive connections__ [or becoming the characters of a larger, untold narrative; the same alternate history of the world found in the _cité des dames_].
	
	- among histories and myth, in the second half of the book we start finding __animal fables__; but the core is __pagan mythology__, with heroes and lovers.
	
100. allegorical readings can at times __contradict__ the explanations of the moral glosses; actaeon is morally a bad example, but allegorically he represents the penitent man who sacrifices his flesh [actaeon becomes a deer].

	- the collection includes __allegorical personifications__ as well, such as the __goddess fortune__ and her __wheel__ [the wheel is __depicted__, but __not mentioned__ in the text]; here the allegory quotes __boethius__.
	
	- some illuminations are especially __inventive__ in their __anachronisms__ and __historical__ adaptations - the __tricks__ and games played by __ulysses__ against his friends become a game of chess in the image.
	
	- there may be a __tragic climax__ in the final section; __images of death__ become more frequent, as do references to the __demise of troy__.
	
	- the final episode is the __sybille cumana__, who advised augustus to wait for jesus' peace; she is the __embodiment of typology__ - the __allegory__ of the __ancient world__ meaning - prefiguring - the christian one [thus, the allegory of typology - or even the allegory of allegory]; but she is also a woman teaching a __male ruler__; the image is the only __christian one__ in the book, depicting the emperor seeing mary and jesus, through the sybille; the allegory cites the __didascalicon__.
