#Medieval Literary Theory and Criticism: The Commentary Tradition

##Introduction

- the period covered goes from __1100__, when the "introductions to the authors" became established [widespread], to 1375, when boccaccio dies [the last author mentioned in the book]; it includes the __xii s. renaissance__, the raise of __scholasticism__, __universities__, and __italian humanism__ [italy being very prolific for glosses].

- these commentaries trace the __story__ of medieval __criticism__; its techniques and vocabulary __emerged__ in the __xii s.__; they were then picked up by __scholastic philosophy__ in the __xiii s.__, and eventually used to discuss the works of __contemporary authors__ in the __xiv__.

- the __xii s.__ saw the establishment of a __critical idiom__; in the __xiii s.__ this was integrated with the __four causes__ [of cardinal importance in themselves] of __aristotelian metaphysics and phyisics__ [__philosophy__ and __critical commentaries__ are slowly merging; the discourses about the universe and those about poetry converge; _it is an interesting question - how did these spaces become spaces of wider pedagogical exposition, concerning not only the text at hand, but also a wide array of disciplines and educational elements? how did this space slowly expand to contain this sort of ecyclopedic knowledge, at times surpassing the contents of the book itself for abundance and diversity - consider, for instance, enrique's glosses to the aeneid?_]; this meant that the __bible__ had a __primary efficient cause__ [__god__] and a __formal and material cause__ [the __author__ of each book - the human writer; _these two levels correspond, arguably, to the two levels of signification, __allegorical__ and __literal__; the second one being at times necessary to the first one_]; __attention__ slowly shifted to the __latter__ [the bible starts having __human authors__, _and editors, and techniques, and circumstances_].

- __two modes__ emerged as well - those of __human sciences__ [logical methods] and those of __sacred science__ [poetic and rhetorical methods; _remember the double reception of aristotle's organon here; according to the earlier medieval commentators, such as the abelard of sic et non, aristotelic logic consisted only of his binary dialectic, including categories and a strict non-contradiction principle; the arabic reception, on the other hand, included the poetic and the rhetoric among the books of the organon, extending logic to the discussion of notions such as the entimema, which provided a less strict system of dichotomies_]; the distincion was used to divide __sacred texts__ from the rest (especially __philosophy__), and to define their __interpretive process__ [maimonides will, for instance, __complicate__ this division _between science and theology_]; eventually __literal__ and __allegorical__ methods, in the xiii and xiv s., began to be used for both __secular__ and __sacred writings__.

- the peak of the trajectory is the __italian xiv s.__, with the wide employment of those techniques in emergent humanist practices [dante uses the analytical __divisio textus__ in the __vita nova__]; dante was using __scriptural exegesis__ for his own works [and his own life, as the emphasis on the _libro della memoria_ exemplifies].

- after the xii s. grammar, and the critical approach to texts, changed; it started to __integrate the methods__ and findings of the __scholastic tradition__; its domain simply expanded.

	- __scholastic literary theory__ was "at the very center [...] of academic endeavor and achievement."

- the xiii and xiv s. were reading and reusing the collections and commentaries of the xii extensively [this arguably produces a continuity between the two moments; remember, however, that this teleological paradigm is not the only one].

##Commentary

1. __an anthology of literary prefaces: introductions to the authors__

	- the __accessus__ was the "__introductory lecture__" with which grammarians began their editions; they discussed the __author__, the __style__, the __goal__ of each book; it could be more detailed [vita, titulus, qualitas carminis, intentio scribentis, numerus iibrorum, ordo librorum, explanatio] or more straightforward [titulus, materia, intentio, modus, utilitas; _this second model is more focused on the moral function of the book; the first one concerned the historical and formal circumstances_]; at times it included a __voice__ devoted to explain the "__part of philosophy__" to which it pertains; these four were often mixed [the latter allegedly became more successful].

	- the second type - more philosophically [and morally] legitimizing [and perhaps more interested in secondary levels of signification] - became the more widespread; most of the books belonged to __ethics__.

	- the examples in the anthology, which were later collected in dedicated __anthologies__, show a __pedagogical preoccupation__; they try to unveil a __concrete pedagogical intention__ [_intentio_], often concealed in __language or figures__ [that is, the author of the book often had an explicit and conscious pedagogical motive; this motive was often an ethical instruction].

	- it is a __powerful instrument__; it is almost __prescriptive__ [cardinal concept] in that it instructs the reader on __how to read a work properly__.

2. __a critical colloquy: conrad of hissau__

	- conrad of hissau (author of speculum virginum) wrote a "__dialogue on the authors__" in the first half of xii s.; the book is in three parts; the first one is a __series of definitions__ related to __textual criticism__; the second one is a series of __21 introductions__ to grammal school texts - a sort of __catalogue of authors__ to read, from the easiest (donatus _followed by the writers of fables_) to the hardest - virgil; the third one is a theory and exposition of the __branches of learning__.

	- the work is remarkable for its abundant discussion of __classic pagan writers__ and for its __lively form__, a believable take on the genre of the __pedagogic dialogue__ between __pupil and teacher__ [perhaps this formal proximity with the genre of _dream vision_ - boethius, and its fictional dialogues between the dreamer and the guide, has further implications].

	- the pupil is very verbose; the teacher insists on the __pedagogical proximity__ between __pagan works__ and the teachings of the scripture [ovid's metamorphoses are very problematic _given their strongly religious content_].

3. __scriptural allegory and authority: hugo of st. victor, peter abelard, and peter lombard__

	- the chapter starts with a quotation from borges where the __inexhaustible hermeneutic research__ applied to the bible is justified as __rational__ - because the bible was "the work of an __infinite mind__" [completely devoid of contingency]; all of these authors worked in the __xii s.__.

	- hugh was an __instructor in paris__ when he wrote the __didascalicon__, a book obsessed with __order and method__; his theory on __things as signifiers__ in the bible is remarkable ("ox" is a word which means a thing - the animal - which means another thing - the evangelist); he also reminds his readers that at times there is __only literal meaning__, and at times this meaning is the __most important layer__ ([)alongside the author's __intention__).

	- hugh was a __conservative__; __abelard__, instead, was an __innovator__; his work, the "sic et non" [strictly based on the aristotelian dialectic method, and in itself the initiator of a critical tradition], is a list of __condtradictory problems__ posed to the reader of the bible, preceded by a __prologue__, where he explains that these can be caused by __polysemy, homonymy, figurative language__, or __sensitive context__ [that is, context that changes the meaning of a word; _the principle of non-contradiction is here applied to its utmost consequences, in order to test the ultimate logical reliability of the scripture; figurative and allegorical language, however, bend the rigidity of these premises_]; his project was also that of __confuting__ the assumption for which the scriptures are __divinely inspired__ down to the very last word [a dangerous, potentially explosive intellectual motive]; but this assumption animated his own __critical work__, such as his _commentaries on st. paul's epistle to the romans_ [where every word is immensely meaningful, and exhausted in all its secondary possibilities].

	- __peter lombard__'s _commentary on the psalter_ is indebted to the __accessus__ tradition; he was a very __influential__ grammarian; the choice [_of using the secular accessus for a sacred text_] created continuity between __holy and secular writings__, and a strongest sense of __human authorship__ for the scripture; he praises the person of __david__, explains his choices for __title, order, intention, form__. [what seems to be happening here is that the allegorical commentary and interpretation used for the scripture start to be used for other forms of writing as well; whereas the philological attention to the historical circumstances peculiar to secular texts was transferred to the scriptures].

4. __poetic fiction and truth: william of conches, bernard silvester, arnulf of orleans, and ralph of longhamps__

	- __historia__ (truth, distant in time) and __fabula__ (ficticious story) were established as __two different genres__ by __ancient literary theorists__; but the separation became problematic when it was acknowledged that __fiction__ could conceal or contain __truth__ [about __morality__, __physics__, __metaphysics__; _that is, fiction could have a true content and purpose_], like in the bible [complex parallel; when is the bible fictional? when its language becomes figurative?].

	- __homer__ was, for instance, often accused of __falsifying__ the events of the __trojan conflict__; comenting on __lucan's bellum civile__, a historically accurate poem [or considered as such], arnulf reminds his readers that the work distinguishes between __historia__ and __fabula__ explicitly [by signalling a lack in exact sources whenever one becomes the other], and it uses the latter only to present __valid__, transcendent examples [useful throughout time; _we can assume, then, that historia is what is true once, whereas fabula, when morally sound, is always valid, because it is exemplary_]; poets generally write __fabulae__, historiographers historiae.

	- __satire__ posed problems for this classification; a poetic work addressing __historical truths__ - as the commentary to juvenal by william of conches explains.

	- "bernardus'" commentary to vergil, like william's, strive to find a more __comprehensive classification__; they praise fabulae as __meaningful allegories__, useful to teain poets such as vergil, who combined the two types to achieve a __philosophical pedagogy__.

	- the poetical "__integumentum__" (first layer) could have been used by __pagan authors__ to conceal many sorts of truths; williams applies this method of __removal of the integumentum__ to boethius, where the metres are a perfect combination of __poetry__ and __philosophy__ [the purpose of the commentary is therefore to remove the integumentum, to reveal the philosophical core].

	- ralph's commentary on the anticlaudianus focuses on his theory and exposition of the __arts__; it is carefully designed for easy consultation.

5. __the dionysian imagination: thomas gallus and robert grosseteste__

	- pseudo-dyonisus' "the celestial hierarchy" was heavily commented in the middle ages [like all of his works]; in the early xiii s. its greatest commentators [for this work and the rest of the author's corpus] were __thomas gallus__ and __robert grosseteste__ (from vercelli and from lincoln).

	- grosseteste completed __new translations__ from the greek as well as commentaries on them; but gallus' work was more accessible and thus popular.

	- the __core__ of dionysus' work [christian neoplatonist who wrote in the __v-vi s.__; he transposed the whole of __pagan neoplatonism__ - from plotinus to proclus - into a new christian context; the works that survive are four treatises and ten letters] was a __justification__ and __explanation__ of __figurative language__ in the __bible__, indispensable to think about __divine matters__ (and _for_ the __human thought__ in general; for _pseudo_ d. we _always_ think in __images__).

	- __images__ are, however, only a __starting point__, and they should be left behind once we ascend to __higher and more pure contemplation__ [this is all in dante]; for grosseteste, this contemplation existed __above rational capacities__; these ideas were later abundantly reused by the author of __the cloud of unknowing__.

	- __every object__ [either celestial and close to transcendence, like light, or base and terrestrial, like worms] can become a __figura of god__ - it is both __like__ and __unlike__ him (god can be defined only __negatively__, _like for maimonides; it is a matter of degrees_); finally, for dyonisus, the function of these __figurae__ was both to __display__ and to __conceal__ (to those who are not worthy - like an __illiterate person__ looking at a __written page__ _the signs are nothing more than black scratches on a page, casual and irrational_ - where signs all contribute to the creation of a __higher meaning__, __beyond the signifier__ - and what if i _eat the signifier_?).

6. __scriptural science and signification: from alexander's "sum of theology" to nicholas of lyre__

	- the __influence of aristotle__ on every aspect of human knowledge after the xiii s. cannot be overstated; he changed the tradition of the __accessus__, with the __four causes__; and he influenced the perception of __authorship and authority__ [how are these two traditions complementing each other, the neoplatonic attention to figural language and to physics as a vector to metaphysics, and the aristotelian emphasis on the historical and concrete side of textual criticism? remember, besides, that all these things were happening at the same time, different strands occurring without a strong sense of teleology; __aristotelic__ and __neoplatonic__ seem a reasonable way to split this history]; he changed epistemology and __semantics__, prompting critics to value the "__body__" and __literal sense__ of scripture mode.

	- in the __xiii s.__ the __aristotelian prologue__, based on __four causes__, became the most popular; in the __1230s__, in __paris__, it started to be used for __scriptural texts__; one cause - __principal efficient__ - would be __god__; the second one, __secondary__ or __instrumental__, the __actual writer__; this led to acknowledging, for instance, the diverse __psalmists__ and the __editor__ of the book [of psalms].

	- a different issue concerned the __scientific__ status of theology; its reliance on the __poetical form__ of the __scripture__ would prevent it [from] to be considered as such. other commentators agreed that the goal of the bible is not only __instruction__ of __knowledge__ but also shaping of __love__ and __correct behavior__ [that is, beyond _scientific_ - anagogic - enlightement, the bible would provide its reader with ethical precepts]; therefore the work uses __poetry__ to __move us__ [here is the __pedagogical importance__ of poetry, shaping our emotional reactions; _poetry is protreptic; it instruct by creating an affective response, and by guiding it through a pedagogical path_]; in this it was __superior to science__ and ethically relevant.

	- the scriptures would offer many different things to many __different readers__ ["milk to beginners and solid food to initiates," according to alexander; the idea is that of _literal sense_ being more appealing to shallow readers, whereas the experienced ones can start looking at the signs hidden beyond the signs - the secondary levels of signification; not far from pseudo-dionysus' idea of allegory as a way to both __reveal__ and __conceal__].

	- the form of these __discussions__ on __meaning__ (_disputationes_ with two parties arguing about correct interpretation, until a __solution is found__; _in this very reminiscent of the political context of parliament of fowls, probably indebted to these aristotelic forms of disquisition_) was common in __scholastic thought__.

7. __placing the poetics: herman the german; an anonymous question on the nature of poetry__

	- hermann the german translated averroes' commentary to __aristotle's poetics__ in 1256 (it was an exposition or __interpretation__ of the philosopher); the book was the __most successful__ edition of aristotle's treatise [think about the transmission history here; the greek text arrived in europe as the latin translation of an arabic commentary to it]; but it was just a __latin translation__ of averroe's commentary, without any actual word by aristotle, and explicitly so.

	- __poetry__ [as a skill] was a hard discipline to classify; it could be either __ethics__ [presumably for its function] or __logic__ [presumably for its means].

	- in hermann's translation we find the idea that poetry is exclusively __blame__ or __praise__ [the idea become a commonplace of medieval literary practices].

8. __updated approaches to the classics: william of aragon, nicholas trevet, giovanni del virgilio, and pierre bersuire

	- poetry was eventually recognized as a __part of logic__ [probably only by a majority], and developed as such in the __s. xiii__ and __xiv__; works of poetry were equated to works of logic [again, we can assume that maimonide's guide had a role in this slow transformation].

	- a site to be considered for the study of __medieval literary theory__ is the tradition of "__teaching collections__," anthologies of classical authors created by grammarians.

	- nicholas trevet studied and taught at oxford in the early xiv s.; his work shows a gradual but steady __expansion of the medieval classical canon__; this change was especially visible in italy, as giovanny del virgilio's commentary on the __metamorphoses__ exemplifies; __pierre bersuire__, an acquaintance of petrarch in the s. xiv, wrote a moralized metamorphoses - the "__moral rediction__" that was probably read by __chaucer__, __gower__, and __lydgate__.

	- __allegory__ was an instrument to __adapt__ [_transform_] literary __authorities__ to the different doctrines or systems favored by each commentator.

	- comments often became __translations__ [complete rewritings of a work; _the linguistic circumstances are very influential, here too - the transition from latin into vernacular accompanied and affected the practices of textual theory_]; their form varied from __marginal glosses__ to __mixtures of commentaries glosses__, to __complete rewritings__.

9. __the transformation of the critical tradition: dante, petrarch, and boccaccio__

	- the big innovation of dante's project is the employment of "__vulgari__"; translation had become a substantial part of intellectual practices in the __xiii s.__ [this is a __decisive change__]; __jean de meun's translation of boethius__ (~1300), for instance, functioned as a support to the understanding of the original, read alongside it.

	- boccaccio accomplished his __vernacular teseida__ with a set of explanatory notes and __glosses__ that mimicked his latin models; the same - or almost the same - happened with dante's __vita nuova__ and __convivio__, where the same techniques were used for his production and, somehow, his own life - the "libro della memoria" for which he was but a "__chiosatore__"; he was appropriating the "__principles and terminology__" of __academic literary theory__ [for himself; and for life itself - for history itself].

	- __allegory__ is introduced as a __pervasive device__ in the __convivio__ [the __convivio__ opens, again, with a discussion of __aristotelian causality__; it could be inferred that __multiple causes__ corresponded to the __multiple layers of meaning__ and significatio; of textuality; _but this conflation may be misleading_]; __amor__ was one of its main problems; in the aristotelian conception, love is a distraction from the real pursuit, that for caritas, divine and altruistic love; in dante, amor is the leading motive; to reconcile these antinomic perspectives, __commentaries__ would clarify the actual scope of both sentiments, __moralizing__ the main exposition [this is the problem posed by romance and fin'amor in its tradition; its profanity would be reduced only by an allegorical understanding; dante attributed the same function to the dichotomy __latin__ - __vernacular__; but this also meant that __literary theory__ had to be applied to __vernacular texts__ as well; dante relied on the classification of allegory as well - "__secular allegory__" is a single layer of __moral interpretation__, implied in some secular texts [and probably operating through synecdoche or generalization]; __scripture__ has a three-fold allegory, containing __tropology__, __anagogy__, and - again - __allegory__ (or "[pre]figura," or "typology"); dante's intepretation is always __secular__ (one layer), although at times he invokes a moral and an anagogical reading [pure heterodoxy].

	- the value of the __literal meaning__ of divina commedia depends on its status - either __historia__, truth that ought to be valued as meaningful and rich, such as the scripture, or __fabula__, fiction that is solely used to convey deeper layers of meaning (the "allo" of allegory).

	- boccaccio groups __poetry__ with __philosophy__ and __theology__; poetry and theology share some instruments (allegory); poetry and philosophy share a purpose [supposedly knoledge, or human betterment].

10. __assessing the new author: commentary on dante

	- the commedia became immensely popular in the __s. xiv__; this popularity prompted the need for __commentaries and glosses__; most of these apparati were written in latin.

	- the _epistola a can grande_, the beginning of dantean criticism often attributed to dante himself, is "__momentous__" in that it applies [this set of techniques to a living author] - for the first time - "the analytic procedures generated over centuries of expounding scripture and allegorizing ancent, pagan poems are now to be applied to the work of a living, christian poet writing in a living language, his own vernacular"; the quality of the __fabula__ [of the _commedia_], resembling and absorbing __historia__, made a flat allegorical exposition [based on straight correspondences between primary and secondary meaning] unconvincing; therefore, the genre of commentary had to evolve [not the best term to describe the process; it certainly had to integrate __aristotelian__ and __platonic__ strands of critical practices].
