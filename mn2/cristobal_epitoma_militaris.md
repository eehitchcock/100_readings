#La versión castellana medieval de la Epitoma Rei Militaris - Alfonso de S. Cristóbal

##Introduction

- vegecio escribió la "epitoma" entre 383 y 450 (fifty years before boethius); it is a work in four of five books [depending on the edition]. one describes the __recruitment and training of troops__, with notes about encampments; the second one describes the __organization of legions__ in the past; the third is about the preparation and execution of __battles__; the fourth one describes __sieges__ and __naval battles__.

- the text was translated __eighteen times__ between 1272 and 1475 - in __six different vernaculars__. one of the translators is __jean de meun__ (1284); the others are in italian, german, english, catalan, spanish.

- the spanish version by san cristóbal was completed between the __xiv__ and the __xv__ s.; it is the only __complete and direct translation__ from the __latin original__; it survives in __seven mss__ [but it is probably an unfinished project].

- like the __eneida__ by enrique de villena (written for the king of navarra), this translation was dedicated to a __sovereign__ [it mirrors, therefore, the features of a _speculum principis_] - either enrique iii or enrique iv (__king of castilla león__ between  xiv and xv).

- the translation is generally __accurate__, and its choices well justified.

- the translation features __two set of glosses__ - __explicative__ and __spiritual__; these ran alongside the entire text, whose actual layout is still debated (either __vertical__ or __horizontal__).

##Commentary

- __preface__; san cristóbal explains that men fight not only the __physical battles__ against their mortal enemies, but also __spiritual battles__ against transcendent enemies - vices and temptations; therefore, his work is divided into three parts: the __translation__ ("romançandolo") of vegetius' war treatise; the gloss on the margin, "de los sabidores que concurdan con lo que dize vegeçio," a __commentary on the literal meaning__ [intertextual and editorial; cristóbal is explicitly mediating between different "sabidores," and referring to their works]; the third, which uses what vegetius says to discuss virtues and sins; a __moral and spiritual teaching__.

- __prologue__; vegetius talks about the importance of the __art of war__, which prompted him to write the book, to assist readers into gain more and more by fighting [war is wat we use to improve our mortal condition, vegetius seems to imply]; in the __first commentary__, san cristóbal quotes some evidence to support vegetius' claim - __examples from the scriptures and classical history__ that confirm the importance of the __ars belli__; in the spiritual comment, s. cristóbal explains that "toda nuestra vida es caballería e continuada batalla" (a quotation from job - "nonne militia est vita hominis super terram?"), so that we need these teachings even more when we fight our __spiritual battles__; the greatest battle, as we know, is against the devil.

	- we find a quick synopsis: the first book is about choosing and training the right men for war; the second is about the "antigua caballería"; the third about fighting on land; the fourth cities and sea.

1. every book begins with an index describing the contents of ever chapter.

	- the __principles of the literal glosses__ seem to be:

		- the __divisio textus__ - in parts that are then __paraphrased__ and __summarized__ [analysis];

		- the __addition__ of __examples__ and __evidence__ from __sacred__ or __secular__ authorities;

		- the __expansion__ of some concepts, expounded for __pedagogical purposes__.

	- the __spiritual glosses__ may take the shape of __translations__ - or __rewritings__ - of the __literal glosses__ [not that dissimilar from villena]; the ideas that were paraphrased and expanded in the first gloss are then adapted, somehow __translitterated__, in the second one.

	- at times san cristóbal corrects and mitigates some of vegetius' statements, referring to other parts of the book, or to other textual authorities; in this sense, it is another sort of __hypertext__, of guide to further reading.

	- the __physical attributes__ required by the __ideal warrior__ are transferred to __spiritual virtues__ that a christian should have; an __ample chest__ is abundance [broadness] of __charity__; a __straight column__ is a __contemplative attitude__; the __adjectives__ are now referred to __abstract qualities__ [the transformation is both linguistic - words applied to new signifiers, their connotation changing only slightly, and never their actual referent - and allegorical - things understood from a different perspective, meanings attributed to things].

	- some chapters have no spiritual glosses, and very short explanatory glosses; san cristóbal does not build anything unexpected [but the work is incomplete, so that it is hard to figure out what his actual intentions for this section may have been; perhaps he actually intended to adapt every aspect of military life, as described in the treatise, to the spiritual fight of christianity].

	- nevertheless, the section on the __pedagogy of the warrior__ ends with a list of __correspondences__ between __war__ and __religious activities__ - each __action__ that a knight should learn - throwing javelins, arrows, stones, piercing with a sword, riding a horse, can be equated to a __christian act__, both __concrete__ (moral, physical deeds of good) and __abstract__ (__contemplative virtues__); the __sacraments__ became weapons against the devil, for all of us [san cristóbal is creating a linguistic system of equivalences, where the allegorical interpretation functions as a secondary translation, depending on the vernacular expansion of the primary one - from signifier to signifier; but he is also referring to a pre-existing tradition of chivalric ideology, where the physical objects - armor, weapons - and gestures attributed to the warrior acquired a new significance - things as signifiers, like in the scripture - or more].

2. the technical sections of the second book, where the structure of the old legions is explained in detail, are accompanied by no gloss, neither __literal__ nor __spiritual__; are they __self-explanatory__? or simply less important? [it is important to consider the editorial history of the text here, which was probably meant to be more exhaustive.]

	- the book describes some strategical notions too [an actual speculum principis, then, useful both in war and in peace].

3. the third book has no spiritual glosses; it is a book of military strategy (we also find a number of terminological clarifications, and some further examples from the bible and auctores).

4. the first section of the fourth book concerns walls and fortifications; therefore the explanatory gloss includes a long list of __cities and founders__ of cities, from the old testament to classical history; it is a __history of the world__ through its cities and craftsmen; it is followed by a list of __arts and inventors__ (writing, law, music...); a surprising digression, perhaps used to remind the reader of the limited importance of each [but also a testament to the encyclopedic quality of these commentaries; from a small element of the primary source - the way in which one should build a wall - we can begin to consider the whole universe - the way in which every wall has been built since the beginning of time; paraphrasing saint victor, with these stones one could build anything - with these stones everything else has been built; language - and now every language, not simply latin but vernacular as well - possesses the same inexhaustible quality of the scripture; every word is a network of potential connections through time and thought].

	- the section about sieges has no notes of any kind, neither literal nor spiritual; the only gloss found in the last section is a paraphrasis of the calendar for good navigation, and winds.
