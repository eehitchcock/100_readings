#Enrique de Villena - Traducción y glosas de la Eneida

##Introduction and "Carta al Rey de Navarra"

- its author translated and written into __catalan__ and __castilian__; this translation was completed alongside the __divina commedia__ [confirming the fact that dante had become a __canonical author__, to whom __glosses and interpretation__ had to be applied, _like for vergil_]. more notable works by him include a handbook for poets - the "__arte de trovar__" [1417-1428], and an __allegorical and moralizing__ "__doce trabajos de hércules__," where foreign myth was adapted to __contemporary spain__ [a project at all not dissimilar from that of the _eneida_].

- when he died he was considered a necromancer.

- his translation of __vergil__ is the first into vernacular.

- the letter simply explains the difficulty that villena had in finding equivalent expressions to vergil's form [like san cristóbal, he seems a careful, sensible translator; _he also explains that he was not able to send the book to the rey of navarra, because of a tense political situation_].

##Commentary

0. __prohemio__. it begins like an __accessus__, providing biographical information about the author; but soon the exposition focuses on minute episodes, told with an extraordinary degree of precise narrative detail [this anticipates the particularization of later sections, where vergil's text is fragmented before being expounded]; we have the story of vergil's approach to the emperor octavian, accomplished through a careful presentation of his lines, on the wall facing his private door - "sic vos non vobis" (an exemplum; _the incomplete lines presented to the emperor, and requiring a personal intervention by the author to be fully understood, may provide a parallel to the work of the commentator, who similarly writes the "second half" of the poem for us_).

	- then enrique explains the function of vergil's work, where the __secondary meanings__ can provide __valid examples__ for contemporary rulers [ethical pedagogy; the book as a speculum principis].

	- he also explains the principles of his translation, which at times becomes an __adaptation__ of his work; he has also added some symbols for punctuation and intonation; and for the __different sections__ of the book [this is the work of an __editor__ - he is describing the __formal visual features__ - the layout - of his edition; _the new arrangement of the work, with small and easily accessible sections, may suggest different reading practices; the work is read like a gospel; the overarching story is familiar, and ultimately irrelevant; what matters is the thorough interpretation of these small units, which can be read and expounded in one sitting_].

	- the glosses that accompany the text are incredibly thorough; they were written by the same author, although he uses the __first person__ in the text and the __third person__ in the notes; he expands some references and episodes, providing __historical background__ and __additional exposition__ (concering, for instance, the arts and their pedagogical classification); in this, it truly resembles a __hypertext__ [constantly linked to further readings]; many definitions and contextual notes; explaining the __literal level__.

1. in the glosses enrique adds the explanation of the four causes for which poets write __figuratively__ (to appeal to __diverse audiences__; to be __concise__; to address __general issues__; to address __general vices__ _supposedly without blaming any single individual_) and one of the __four genres__ (tragedy, satire, comedy, lyricism _or lyric; vergil's aeneid belongs to the first one_).

2. for now the emphasis of the glosses remains on a complete understanding of the __literal sense__, with notes on __history, geography, and mythological stories__; the __literal__ isn't obvious [it requires further explanation; it is expanded and justified in every aspect, including religion; we have, of course, a remarkable focus on historical difference, almost philological in detail].

4. here we find one of the first __allegorical__ explanations, of the __moral__ sort; juno makes a deal with eolo, in the same way that rich powerful men need the help of friends [it is more of a __generalization__, not precisely allegory; it is a teaching that can be accessed by interpreting the passage as a synecdoche]; later enrique applies __aristotelian physics__, explaining that the number fourteen implies "quatorce impresiones" [aristotelian qualities applied to an object].

5. the __same method__ [because it is a method; every single passage - every unit - has to be exhausted in these multiple ways - historical, ethical, and tropological] applied to the previous chapter is operating here; narrative details of the literal level are integrated with __aristotelian physics__ [but this level could hardly be defined anagogical, since it is not figurative - it is an expansion of the literal], with specific meanings slightly altered; behaviors are generalized - they become exemplary synecdoches for __moral instructions__; finally, enrique adds a detailed list of the __main gods__ of greek religion, all of them __literally explained__ [that is, religion is understood as a component of the historical layer, and it has - therefore - to be read and understood in detail].

6. the process of glossing includes __paraphrasis__ and a __systematic__ reference to the __rhetorical figures__ employed - here the "fantasía" that attributes human verbs to nonhuman natural agents [personification or _fictio_]. enea's fleet of ships is compared to the __senses__, shaken by the __misfortune of vice__ [this may be actual tropology]; the identification is supported by __etymology__ (the names of the ships' commanders refer to the various __organs of sense__) and __literary devices__ (the adjectives that are used confirm the analogy; they are the connection between _vehicle_ and _tenor_ - the _ground_).

7. every level of the __allegorical tex__ is expanded and developed __simultaneously__; the scientific exposition of the literal level; the __moral psychomachia__ (or _synecdoche_) of the allegorical level [probably tropology], with religious and psychologic counterparts to every physical action of the story; the text, then, functions as a __unifying principle__, a __coherent container of sense__ [like the scripture; vergil's book, therefore, becomes a _world-book_, like the Scripture; a book were every _thing_, and not just every _word_, functions as a signifier].

	- a __scientific understanding__ of the literal level allows us a deeper comprehension of the moral one [this is what happens with san cristóbal's _vegecio_ too; the intermediate translation, that of the literal gloss, an epansion of the historical layer, is needed to access the final translation, the allegorical layer beyond it; the text is first expanded, then translated into something new].

9. the general understanding is that the __shipwreck__ of the opening is a __moral loss__, from which one recovers with __virtue__ and __moral contemplation__ [this is the tropology, the ethical psychomachia into which vergil's poem has been translated]; enrique is using the epic text to construct a "__speculum principis__"; like the __didascalicon__ taught [the _stonemason_ metaphor], the narrative stones of secular and sacred texts can be used to build familiar shapes; here we find __aristotelian science__ and __christian ethics__. again, these are employed simultaneously, for a __pedagogical purpose__ [and this explains the two layers required; the first layer transforms _historia_ into aristotelian physics, into a cosmic contemplation of nature; the second layer turns physics into metaphysics - _as maimonides says, the understanding of metaphysics requires the existence of physics_].

15. __synecdoche__ is, like nowadays, one of the most powerful ways to intepret a passage; by generalizing its scope - not about an __individual__, but about a __condition__, a group or a __quality__ - one can understand more about the author's intentions; about the actual __moral message__; __exemplary tales__.

	- at times, instead, he focuses on narrative techniques [analepsis and prolepsis].

16. here enrique explains that eneas' dialogue with venus is nothing more than a dramatization of his thoughts [a very interesting way of understanding the textual surface; it is figurative, but not allegorical nor precisely metaphorical; it has a sort of psychological valence, a clarification that reinforces the believability of the _historia_, without substantially altering its signifiers].

17. often enrique justifies the characters' actions or reactions, explaining the psychological happenings that animate the __literal__ level of the narrative; the author's choices are all considered __intentional__ [both assumptions may remind us of the scriptures; on the one hand, the historical difference justifies the explanation of behavior; on the other, the author is infallible - the contradictions found in the text are only apparent, and their resolution can only improve our understanding of the text].

18. the temple where eneas sees the suffering of the trojan people, in a touching scene of __empathy__ (for the contemporary reader), is a sign of the __mortal world__, full or rich and moving distractions [the two sides of the fight, therefore, may stand for immanence and transcendence; aeneas is not fighting against a physical enemy, but against sin itself - it was a _spiritual fight_, like the ones evoked in the introduction to cristóbal's _vegecio_], where one finds oneself, after sin and redemption; each story [depicted on the walls of the trojan palace in carthage, where aeneas now is] is a [piece of] mortal wealth, a sinful pleasure found in the world. eneas is, again, the sinful soul redeemed, but risking a new fall.

23. as he insists on the parallel between eneas and the __mortal man__ [synecdoche and tropology], enrique uses some of the __terminology__ popular in the period: "E viniendo a la moralidat, siquiere allegórico entendimiento, revelando los secretos que virgilio ministra, en estos __integumentos__ ystoriales, significa ..."; eneas now has to reach for the __three theological virtues__ - _christian ethics_ [tropology; ethics is always applied to the mortal world - it is a _speculum pricipis_].

26. some glosses expand the literal meaning of the text in suprisingly articulate ways; enrique uses the text of vergil to teach as many things as possible - rhetoric, ethic, history, the exercise is to __exhaust the implications__ of the historical level, and to build with it as many allegories as possible [the same purpose expressed in the didascalicon; only with more pieces - _not only the scriptures_ - and more buildings - _not only the mysteries of christianity_].

27. towards the end of the book, the glosses have __surpassed the text__ in abundance; enrique is translating and expanding each passage many times.

	- he is very attentive to the __five senses__ [this is part of the process of expanding reality - reality percieved in every possible way, through - _in_ every possible sense]; he tries tp describe the same scene from the perspective of each of them - it is a __banquet of senses__ [the most commented section is indeed about __food__; enrique has a lot to say about __temptation__].

28. the same __hermeneutical abundance__ occurs in the following book, with the wine - "aquello que se non pudo escusar por declarar el textual entendimiento latente so la corteza literal" [__verbose sin__].

29. the final note reiterates the project of the book - to tell how "el ombre sole de los viçios e alcança las virtudes"; the glosses have mostly been an expounding of "la manera de la prospera fortuna" [that is, the glosses paradoxically allowed the reader to know more about sin; to read sin beyond the layers of _historia_ - in the same way that one ought to read danger and mortality beyond "fortuna"].
