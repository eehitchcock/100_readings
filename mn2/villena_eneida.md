#Enrique de Villena - Traducción y glosas de la Eneida

##Introduction and "Carta al Rey de Navarra"

- its author translated and written into __catalan__ and __castilian__; this translation was completed alongside the __divina commedia__ [confirming the fact that dante had become a __canonical author__, to whom __glosses and interpretation__ had to be applied, _like for vergil_]. more notable works by him include a handbook for poets - the "__arte de trovar__" [1417-1428], and an __allegorical and moralizing__ "__doce trabajos de hércules__," where foreign myth was adapted to __contemporary spain__ [a project at all not dissimilar from that of the _eneida_].

- when he died he was considered a necromancer.

- his translation of __vergil__ is the first into vernacular.

- the letter simply explains the difficulty that villena had in finding equivalent expressions to vergil's form [like san cristóbal, he seems a careful, sensible translator].
