#Enrique de Villena - Traducción y glosas de la Eneida

##Introduction and "Carta al Rey de Navarra"

- its author translated and written into __catalan__ and __castilian__; this translation was completed alongside the __divina commedia__ [confirming the fact that dante had become a __canonical author__, to whom __glosses and interpretation__ had to be applied, _like for vergil_]. more notable works by him include a handbook for poets - the "__arte de trovar__" [1417-1428], and an __allegorical and moralizing__ "__doce trabajos de hércules__," where foreign myth was adapted to __contemporary spain__ [a project at all not dissimilar from that of the _eneida_].

- when he died he was considered a necromancer.

- his translation of __vergil__ is the first into vernacular.

- the letter simply explains the difficulty that villena had in finding equivalent expressions to vergil's form [like san cristóbal, he seems a careful, sensible translator; _he also explains that he was not able to send the book to the rey of navarra, because of a tense political situation_].

##Commentary

0. __prohemio__. it begins like an __accessus__, providing biographical information about the author; but soon the exposition focuses on minute episodes, told with an extraordinary degree of precise narrative detail [this anticipates the particularization of later sections, where vergil's text is fragmented before being expounded]; we have the story of vergil's approach to the emperor octavian, accomplished through a careful presentation of his lines, on the wall facing his private door - "sic vos non vobis" (an exemplum; _the incomplete lines presented to the emperor, and requiring a personal intervention by the author to be fully understood, may provide a parallel to the work of the commentator, who similarly writes the "second half" of the poem for us_).

	- then enrique explains the function of vergil's work, where the __secondary meanings__ can provide __valid examples__ for contemporary rulers [ethical pedagogy; the book as a speculum principis].

	- he also explains the principles of his translation, which at times becomes an __adaptation__ of his work; he has also added some symbols for punctuation and intonation; and for the __different sections__ of the book [this is the work of an __editor__ - he is describing the __formal visual features__ - the layout - of his edition; _the new arrangement of the work, with small and easily accessible sections, may suggest different reading practices; the work is read like a gospel; the overarching story is familiar, and ultimately irrelevant; what matters is the thorough interpretation of these small units, which can be read and expounded in one sitting_].

	- the glosses that accompany the text are incredibly thorough; they were written by the same author, although he uses the __first person__ in the text and the __third person__ in the notes; he expands some references and episodes, providing __historical background__ and __additional exposition__ (concering, for instance, the arts and their pedagogical classification); in this, it truly resembles a __hypertext__ [constantly linked to further readings]; many definitions and contextual notes; explaining the __literal level__.
