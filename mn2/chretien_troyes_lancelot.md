#Chretien de Troyes - Lancelot

##Introduction

- remarkable literary personality; five poems that bear his distinctive mark - that of a recongizable author; one author that expressed himself across five distinct works. this is very _uncommon_ for the context of the roman.

- another almost unique feature is his lack of introductory or explanatory moves: his intentions are _not clarified_, not allegorical.

- little is known about his literary figure | historical person, besides what we read in the works themselves. he _names himself_ "crestien de troies" in the _erec_, and we have some historical context in the opening of _lancelot_.

- we find in his works quotations from _ovid_ and from _vergil_; he was probably a _clerk_ (or an intellectual in general); the court of marie de champagne hosted __many intellectuals__ from the __xii s.__ renaissance.

- yvain (le chevalier au lion) and lancelot (le chevalier de la charette) were both written between 1177 and 1181. this is the moment of the _first gothic art in france_.

- the source of chretien's arthurian cycle is __wace's brut__ (drawn from Geoffrey of Monmouth); it explored the 12 years of peace under arthur.
	- in a way, chretien's aim was that of completing wace's work.

- these are the _first known examples of arthurian romance_.

- there is a remarkable unity of space and time throughout the 5 poems.

##Commentary

- 1-32: the incipit to the work is a poetical statement - _dense_ and allusive. it is dedicated to _marie de champagne_, who had a court of writers, artists, intellectuals in the 1170s and 1180s. the voice of the poet, recognizable and strong, instantiates a _dialogue_ with the public and its main interlocutor - the __dame__ herself. the project is immediately _intertextial_: chretien compares his intention and his voice to that of other poets who might want to "losangier sa dame." the praise itself is in the _conditional mode_ - "dirai je." the second intertextual element is the way in which the work is introduced, as something drawn from both his "__sains ne painne__" (intellect and labor) and her instruction, intention, inspiration - "__ses comandemanz__ - __matiere e san__" (matter and sense). a work of translation, compilation, imitation. On the one hand, the feminine "matiere et san"; on the other, his own "painne et [...] atancion." disowning a portion of the work's essence.

- 40: the women at arthur's court "_bien parlant an lengue francoise_," as if it was a specific reason of praise; indeed _henry ii_, like arthur, was an English king who could speak french.

- 60: the mysterious knight is a __foreign__ presence, like those seen in _marie_; but he is _completely threatening_. he holds captive a group of "chevaliers, dames et puceles" - "en ma prison | de ta terre e ta meison"

- 61-62: and arthur's reaction is fascinatingly resignated - he will suffer if he can't fix it - "sofrir, s'amander ne le puet." somewhere else, in a _foreign land_, some of my people are suffering. And I cannot help it.

- 83: abrupt transition - the __external problem__ - the prisoners - becomes an __internal problem__ - the seneschalc threatening to leave.

- 156-157: the queen's intervention is what restores _order in the court_.

- 180: we learn that kex's threat was actually a _manipulative move_, to get to spend time with the queen. the _internal and external threat_ are now one.

- 254: after the ominous departure of the queen and kex, we now start following _gawain_; we adopt his __perspective__, while he registers and interprets a series of __hints__ about what is happening and what _has happened_. sense of slow discovery shared by the _reader_. the horse without a knight, the knight with the exhausted horse, the battlefield. eventually we find the core of the story - a knight and his "charrete."

- 348: here we have the mysterious presence of the dwarf: "un nain sur le limons." are we now following yet another knight's point of view? __disorienting.__

- 356: the __quest__ for the ween requires an encounter with the "charrete."

- 372: here we find a conflict between __amors__ and __reisons__ about what should be done; the tone shifts to an ethical or philosophical meditation - the charrete acquires a __symbolical__ valence that remains - now - unexplained.

- 380: we now reencounter gawain. the interplay with perspectives is __clever__ and suspenseful. now the storylines have become _a single one_.

- 422: the group enters a __foreign town__; and they have become the foreigners.

- 426: the description of the tower suggests allegorical spaces: a "prairie," "une roche bise"; there seems to be a dychotomy between __salvation__/__damnation__.

- 446: the dwarf disappears mysteriously: "ne sorent ou il s'an ala."

- 480: now the knights sleep in two wonderful beds; but a third, now even more delicious bed, is still _forbidden_ to them. lancelot - still __unnamed__ - is characterized by an invincible _streben_ - he wants to know "la querele por coi cist liz est an diffanse." _he wants more._

- 499: phenomenal use of the _octosyllabic line_: "jel verrai?" "voire!" "or i parra." split between two characters, like in a tragedy.

- 516: the knight is punished for his __ubris__ - the bed is not for him, so that a spear - "vint une lance come foudre | le fer desoz."

- 529: here is the detail of being _wounded (hurt)_ __only a little__. "si qu'il li a del cuir oste | un po, m'est n'est mie bleciez" just like __sir gawain__.

- 534: the knight sleeps on the bed in any case; the allegory is deliberately obscure.

- 546: technically, chretien's skill is visually striking - notice this __transition__: we see the nameless knight at one window, and gawain on the other; we switch to gawain's perspective (he's busy with a lady) until he sees a __third knight__ approaching the castle. finally the queen is found again; the mystery thickens.

- 576: the knight seems willing to kill himself; the tone is always suggestive.

- 642-644: the foreign law of the beginning returns here - and now it has a __definite owner__ - meleaganz, the son of _roi de gorre_. notice how this _adventure_ works: we have two heroes - one _familiar_ (gawain) and talkative, somehow predictable; the other _strange_, unnamed, and mysterious.

- 672: again, the marvellous is always almost allegorical: two ways to reach a castle - an underwater bridge, and a blade bridge. symbols? or fantasy?

- 702: the characters now part their ways, looking for a way to the other land.

- 715: we have here a wonderful description of the nameless knight - __he has forgotten himself__ - his name, his worth, only for "amors" - the dominant thought.

- 756: lancelot is compared to his own horse - he cannot think, he is almost suicidal (his only thought is love): like a thirsty beast he rushes into a deadly trap - with a hostile knight waiting for him.

- 880: a phenomenal battle between the _nameless one_ and the knight of the ford; and with the nameless one being __almost impotent__ because of his new thought: "s'an est molt dolanz et iriez | quant il est ja anpiriez | qu'il pert ses cos..."

- 892: the knight has now become "li charretons"; violence is set against love. the nameless one's motive is the fact that "et son panser mar li toli."

- 964: the knight has been _merciful_ with the warrior of the ford; now he faces a second trial; a lady wants to sleep with him. he accepts, though sadly; he cannot stop thinking about his own queen.

- 1004: we have here the motive of the _rich exotic castle_; it has no inhabitants at all
	- one thing that chretiens does well is __suspense__ - everything is dreamy and mysterious.

- 1072: we find here an image of _realistic, brutal violence_ - an attempted rape in the empty castle. "c'un chevaliers l'ot anversee, | si la tenoit antraversee."

- 1088: the tone is heavily __sexualized__: tenoit la dameisel cil | descuverte juscqu'au nombril."

- 1104: "li chevaliers a l'uis s'areste": lancelot __stops to think__ - an interior monologue at the worst possible time, delating the time of resolution; instead of acting, lancelot stops to think - paralyzed. paralysis seems the recurrent threat of this dark, violent dream. "malvest iez" halts.

- 1114: and now he regrets talking to himself; while he is still talking to himself. _a coward who cannot recognize himself._ strange what love does.

- 1152: chretiens is also a master of action scenes; here the enemies are _numbered_: the pace is frantic, but one always knows precisely what is happening.

- 1231: phenomenal description of the knight in bed with a woman _he does not want_.
	- chretien chooses this moment to finally describe how his protagonist feels.

- 1276: and then, another fabulous invention - we listen to the lady whom lancelot refused - she expresses her sincere admiration for him; she _understands_ his greatness. 


- 1316: here we have a mention of foreign __customs__ - a custom thaat has banished rape from its society; that abhors rape. is there a connection between this social stigma and the shame of the charette?

- 1343: one amazing line: "pansers li plest, parlers li grieve." love is constant __distraction__.
	- the nameless one has become the lady's protector; he defends her honor.

- 1420: here we find another __clue__, and again the nameless one becomes a _proxy_ for the reader - with him we follow a trail of _evidence_, slowly unveiling the mystery.

- 1476: a couple of precious details - realistic the first one, melodramatic the second one; the lady is ashamed/embarassed about her concern for lancelot's safety; lancelot kisses, holds against his face and his chest the queen's hair.

- 1500: two local comparisons - a fair in sant denis and "cest an este"; chretiens seeks his public's empathy by appealing to their shared experience.

- 1584: a somewhat sympathetic portrait of a sexual predator - the outcome of his encounter with lancelot is so predictable that we almost feel pity for him - compassion; this section seems an exploration of __sexual assault__; can it even be legitimate, the text seems to be asking; men fight for it.

- 1657: enters a "chevaliers auques d'atre" - another ominous appearance, again nameless; by excluding details, or by delivering them slowly chretien creates mystery and suspense.
	- he is the father of the sexual predator; he might legitimize his behavior.

- 1674: how do these people know that that is the knight "qui fu menez sur la charrete!"? the nameless one seems to bear this mark of shame wherever he goes.

- 1752: the circumstance - the conflict - now becomes a debate between __father__ and __son__: the old man thinks that he should cease his assault; but the youth is stubborn.

- 1820: the resolution is surprising: not a fight, but an __agreement__; the father uses his power over the noblemen gathered there to force the son to __give up__ the lady; the son is forced to follow lancelot. diplomatic solution.

- 1848: we see lancelot praying  - a fact that is described as commendable - "ni fist que vileins."

- 1873: one creepy detail - suggestive, again an obscure allegory - the chapel where the nameless has stopped protects a graveyard; on the tombstones we find the names of the arthurian heroes who will lie there - "ci girra gauvains..."

- 1908: the biggest stone is linked to the prisoners "qui sont an la terre an prison": lifting it would free them. "et cil del pais vont et vienent | et anz et fans a lor pleisir." another obscure allegory; __death is a foreign land__.

- 1932: the nameless one now explicitly denies telling his name to the priest. we share, of course, the character's curiosity. this name has a power now.

- 2020: the nameless one is now left by himself; he managed to alienate the assaulted lady.

- 2040: aventure seems to consist primarily of people offering lancelot a place to spend the night. __hospitality__. lancelot as the stranger; the host as the stranger.

- 2060: we finally encounter the mysterious prisoners - in a foreign land. "n'estoient pas del pais ne, | mes il estoient enserre | et prison tenu i avoient."

- 2104: the captivity which brings the visitors of the foreign land is caused by a foreign __custom__: "maleoite soit tes costume | et cil avec qui le mainteinent | que nul estrange ca ne vienent | qu'a rememoir ne lor covaigne."

- 2140: the country is compared to that of the __arabs__ - "an cest pais [...] an ceste gente sarradine | qui peior que sarradin sont." comparable threats.

- 2171: the geography of this foreign land is consistent: here we find the sowrd bridge again.

- 2204: lancelot - the nameless one - has gathered a small army around him. _where is his shame?_

- 2221: nevertheless, people here too seem to know about the charrete. how does this work. there seems to be an obscure connection between the charrete and the foreign country: "ja hom ca venir ne deust | qui sa charrete este eust."

- 2263: a new, unexpected shift in perspective: the narrator's eye is now following the three foreign knights who, protecting the land, attacked lancelot in vain.

- 2316: a messenger describes the arrival of lancelot - a threat to the country - to the trio of knights. they react. __we are now adopting the point of view of the enemy.__

- 2363: lancelot eventually finds himself trapped and emprisoned; the magical ring that he has on his finger cannot help him leave. the question is: _is he unique?_

- 2383: the flight and personal quest becomes a huge war between two armies.

- 2422: "qui nos gitera toz d'essil": he will free from the exile; he is acknowledged as the __liberator__; lancelot's mission too has become the freedom of the whole community.

- 2500: everyone wants to host lancelot. hospitality is a big motive in this work.

- 2576: a new appearance, at the house of the good host, an arrogant knight defies lancelot.

- 2622: "ce li ert mes toz jorz retret." the charrete is an obscure _guilt_ - whose motivations remain unknown. somewhat __kafkaesque__. blamed for no reason.

- 2681: there is a strong emphasis in the fact that lancelot is now using _borrowed arms_.

- 2704: the first part of this bloody duel is a massacre of the two horses. casualties.

- 2774: lancelot wants his opponent to experience the humiliating charrete as well.

- 2787: a new mysterious appearance: - "une pucele [...] desafublee et desliee," riding a mule. a new setting is then revealed - the poem is a sequence of encounters, of aventures, of people casually running into other people.

- 2820: lancelot is now confronted with an __ethical dilemma__ - should he kill or should he spare the hostile knight? the circumstance is marked by an elaborate periphrasis about mary: "pur ce deu qui est filz et pere | et qui de celi fit sa mere | qui estoit sa fille et s'ancele." god becomes a sort of _sexual predator_ as well.

- 2859: the doubt forces lancelot to __paralisis__: "qu'el panser demore et areste."

- 2852: lancelot is the knight of __paralizing doubt__; of thought. here the dilemma becomes a __prison__: "an tel prison, an tel destrece | le tenient pitier et largece." he is the actor of a __psychomachia__; he is thought/will.

- 2883: lancelot's anwer to the doubt is new violence; the duel will decide.

- 2932: the knight is beheaded; lancelot is an agent of __violence__ - and the doubt is a real one; the reader cannot know what he should have done.
	- the lady seems especially cruel. her satisfaction at this death is _disturbing_. was the man another attacker? another predator? another threat?

- 2988: after this fight, lancelot is apparently hosted by the entire foreign land.

- 3015: here we find a lively description of the mysterious "pont de l'espee."
	- the space is suggestive, potentially _symbolical_, yet vivid with realistic or verisimilar details; we also find two large felines at one end of it.
	- the two coward knights describe the threat with bloody details.

- 3122: we learn that lancelot is driven by the benevolent force of __love__: "amor qui le conduist et mainne"; he is now facing the dangerous bridge.
	- here the trial seems more symbolical than realistic.

- 3150: another wonderful transition: from lancelot we shift to the tower and to the evil king watching from its top - _bademaguz_; again another __pov__.
	- we discover that the king is good; his son, meleaganz, is the villain. the two react differently as they perceive lancelot approaching.

- 3183: we find __allegorical personifications__ operating in the poem's economy; _proesce_, _malvester_, _peresce_. Again, the tone becomes _almost allegorical_. almost.

- 3254: another motive of this poem: wise fathers advising inconsiderate sons; we follow the debate in the enemy's tower - there's a diplomatic chance.

- 3327: the wounded hands and feet of course constitute a __christological element__; the king greets the knight - the issue is, again, _hospitality for the stranger._

- 3431: the king bademaguz is _pacific_ - qui la paz queist; his diplomacy is strategic.

- 3480: melegeanz is a great character. his only wish is to fight: "ja mes tant que ge me combate | n'avrai joie ne bien me live" _pure hostility. violence._

- 3522: lancelot is now "le chevalier estrange"; a huge crowd wants to see him fight.
	- he is now fighting for the __captive people__ (like moses) - "por le cheitifs"

- 3580: right before the beginning of the crucial duel with melegreanz, we follow the king until he meets the queen; and now we share _her pov_.
	- the duel is as public as it can get - _many eyes_ watch its development.

- 3588: we suspect that the whole "captive" motive could stand for the __harrowing of hell__.

- 3629: this is clearly the harrowing of hell; but the tone is so vivid that it could be overlooked; the battle is bloody, the violence is emphasized. _expressive rhythmical choices_.

- 3668: we finally learn the name of the knight: an anonymous lady - a proxy for the reader's apprehension - asks the queen, who reveals the name.

- 3684: lancelot finally sees his queen; and - during the crucial fight - he is __paralized__ again. the change is a shift in his perspective - from the battlefield to the _window_ where the queen is. and now he _cannot act any more_.

- 3800: the structure of the duel is triangular - the fighters look up to the king and the queen, and act according to their dispositions. now peace is sought.

- 3824: "nel touchant ne me se muest" - the danger of __paralisis__ is again encountered.

- 3894: the conflict is eventually pacified; however, like in _sggk_, the knights establish to fight again in one year. meleagranz is especially stubborn.
	- another arrangement, like the one with the previous opponent. this is a collective fight - "la bataille | qui tient bretaigne et cornoaille"

- 3980: the queen refuses to greet lancelot happily; and we find here a _splitting_ between his faculties: "des ialz et del cuer la convoie." the eyes are divided from the heart.

- 4017: we find keu the seneschalc again; the two storylines merge, and we learn what had happened to the queen and to the vassal.

- 4140: lancelot is captured by the evil allies of malegreanz, although everyone else is free.

- 4186: we discover a new detail: the queen has a __strong, special__ interest for lancelot.
	- we now have a description of her suffering, following the customary pattern:
		1. an objective description of her state of misery, her fasting, her shrivelled beauty;
		2. an _interior monologue_ where she confesses her love.
	- we also discover that she refused to greet the knight just for a _joke_.

- 4238: guinevere's interest is __certainly sexual__: "certes, tot nu a nu."

- 4268: we now have a mirroring scene where lancelot suffers as well; he attempts suicide.

- 4328: here begins a long monologue where lancelot again expresses all his doubts.

- 4423: this was a moment of _paralisis_ - apparent death - for every character in the poem.

- 4496: the queen now presents a more rational reason for _rejection_: lancelot's hesitance in mounting the _charrete_. is this a true motivation?

- 4530: we are now sure that the queen and lancelot share an adulterous relationship; they will not engage in _sexual intercourse_ - but they wish they could.

- 4646: we now have a __decisive__ attempt to sleep together; lancelot removes any physical obstacle ("de la fenestre desconfine") separating him from pleasure.

- 4695: __sex__ finally happens; notice the detail of lancelot being "hurt a little," again.

- 4707: metaphorical __dissociation__ becomes more and more common for the main character - even here: "li cors s'an vet, li cuers sejorne." if paralisis was the threat of the first lancelot, here what he fears is __dismemberment__.
	- his bleeding pinky left a stained bed behind; a virginal trace of __sin__.

- 4787: the detail of the stained sheets is used to frame keu, not lancelot.

- 4841: the ethical and legal authority that bademaguz has over the queen is striking.

- 4930: lancelot is summoned to defend the queen's honor against malegreanz's accusations; he will protect keu's life; but isn't he fighting for himself?
	- chretien displays _without commenting upon_ the intricate plot of the romance.

- 5000: a new duel between lancelot and malegreanz; this time the knight has sworn to have no mercy; he is defending __truth__ - but is he being _virtueous_? honorable?

- 5022: again, like in the previous episode, the king and the queen impose a halt - paralisis. the king's strategy is that of a constant dilation of action - he is always __postponing__ it to a more fitting circumstance.

- 5060: a _new quest_ is begun, suddenly: lancelot has to find gawain, who is still looking for a way to access the castle on the "pont soz eue."

- 5071: a new mystery: "un nains a l'encontre lor vint | sor un grant chaceor"
	- lancelot follows the dwarf, who is a traitor. and we lose his point of view; we are now sharing the apprehension felt by his soldiers, who look for him.

- 5117: we follow this group of knights as if they were one single character; they have found gawain, who has fallen from the bridge.
	- we do not discover _anything_ about his own adventures yet; instead, he asks the men about lancelot and the queen. storylines merge again.

- 5026: gawain's arrival at the court is somehow funny: everybody feigns interest in him and in his arrival, but they're all actually _worried_ - more than happy - for L.

- 5237: the king uses a system of "messages" to look for lancelot everywhere in the land.

- 5264: the solution arrives through "unes letres" written by lancelot and sent to the king through "uns vaslez." is this a message we can trust?

- 5280: this _written sign is ambiguous_: can we believe that lancelot is now with arthur?

- 5371: the letter was fake: arthur welcomes the queen and gawain, but lancelot is not there. here begins a _secondary plot_: the unmarried ladies at arthur's court have organized a tournament to find good _husbands_.

- 5412: the ladies (another group acting like a _single character_) ask gueneviere to attend the tournament with them - and she has to agree.

- 5427: more virtuosity with the _point of view_: we now follow the __news__ about the tournament from arthur's court, through the foreign land, to the _secret rooms_ where lancelot is being held in _captivity_ by melegreanz.
	- we discover that the keeper of this prison is a lady, who feels sympathy for him.
	- as usual, lancelot has to promise that he will give her his love.

- 5517: between allegorical and simply fantastical: lancelot, in incognito, is hosted, like one of the competitors for the tournament, in a place called "noauz."
	- the word means "worse"; the knight has to live poorly among the poor.

- 5549: a small colorful episode: lancelot is discovered by "un hyraut d'armes an chemise," who announces the knight's arrival shouting "or est venuz qui l'aunera" - a nameless rescuer. people are curious about the __messianic__ prophecy.

- 5647: here we find the motive of the mysterious contender whose identity is concealed; he is praised by all. notice that this happened in the very poem before - he was __nameless__.

- 5657: here the linguistic invention finds a reason: lancelot is asked to fight "au noauz."
	- lancelot therefore starts fighting in the _worse possible manner_, for the queen.

- 5712: this was actually a _trial_ for lancelot, so that the queen could identify him.

- 5785: anotrher customary motive: a description of the _heraldic symbols_ worn by the knights who are competing in the tournament; the emphasis is on the public performance of the fight and the games - lancelot is being public.
	- it is also a moment of _international confrontation_ between knights.

- 5891: after the humiliation of _renouncing violence and force_, lancelot is now asked to fight "au mialz face qu'il porra." he can use violence again.

- 5944: the enemy is, significantly, the son of the king of ireland - a land that must be submitted to imperialistic power. lancelot, like an efficient machine, now simply obeys the __feminine instruction__ (like _chretien as a writer_).

- 6068: again, acting like a single character, the entire group of women decides that they will not marry. silently, the queen rejoices - because she has him.

- 6124: meleagant builds a tower; it is a great work: "macons et charpantiers."
	- the tower is hidden on "uns braz et grand et lez," a strip of land on the sea of gorre; there the villain hides lancelot, prisoner.

- 6200: melegeant's strategy - he's a coward - is to avoid fighting against lancelot.

- 6355: the delicate relationship between melegeant and his father now finds an _abrupt intensification_ - he simply wants to be _heard and respected_. we feel empathy for the son - some of his claims are understandable.

- 6400: we now follow a _new character_ - a girl who looks for lancelot without any piece of information, guide or hint - "__mes par avanture__."
	- her quest lasts more than a month; the number of __women__ who assist lancelot is certainly striking; they are definitely more helpful than men (i.e.: Gawain).

- 6480: here we have the motive of fortune's wheel - the same fortune who, without any rational, explicable cause, led the girl to the tower of lancelot; the description of the wheel is _vivid_: "car c'iere el mont, or sui el val."
	- lancelot's complaint includes scorn against gawain - who is not looking for him.
	- notice how lancelot has also become a __boethian__ figure - imprisoned, saved by a lady.

- 6631: the liberation of lancelot is, of course, similar to his _penetration_ of the queen's room - a small window, forced; but he now leaves, does not enter.

- 6749: lancelot is reaching the court exactly when meleagant is threatening gawain; chretien plays with what we know now more than the villain - "nel feisot il, nel sot pas bien | mes il le caudoit bien savoir."

- 6842: the queen's heart and body are now as _divided_ as lancelot's were; now _adultery_ has become an issue again. chretien uses _rhetorical questions_ to state what should be ovious - to strike the reader - why isn't she here? because she can't be seen with her lover. their _moral status_ is again emphasized.
	- reisons is her ally: reason stops her lust, to wait for the _right moment_.

- 7001: the final battle happens in a _locus amoenus_ that is surely evocative of the _garden of eden_; it also hosts a large tree - a "sagremor gent et bel."

- 7124: in the ending we discover that lancelot is again held prisoner - "anmurez," and this time his prison is an __unfinished story__.
