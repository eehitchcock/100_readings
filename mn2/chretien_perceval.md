#Chr√©tien de Troyes: Perceval

##Comment

20. the frame is that of an __evangelical parable__ - _the_ evangelical parable about sowing and harvesting. the "romans" is "none semance" - and in it one will find "toz le vices et toz le max" - __synecdoche__ of an ethical world. [there are two elements to justify this assumption: the reference to the parable about sowing either fertile or "worthless" ground, and the explicit recipient of text, count philip of flanders, compared to alexander - the quintessential ruler, but also the quintessential disciple; this is a book written to teach a ruler.]

305. chretien emphasizes the __ethical purpose__ of his writing - its ethical value, and effect on the reader. the tale opens in the scene - of hunting - hunters run into knights [it is actually a single hunter, _perceval_, still unnamed; he lives in the _Waste Forest_, the son of a widow, and watches harrowers and knights]. the circumstance seems that of a "vaslez" [peasant boy] mistaking a group of __beautifully armored knights__ for angels [initially for devils; _and the mistake is intensely problematic - in a way, it is an allegorical process; the boy is endowing reality with a transcendent, metaphysical layer_], welcoming him to heaven, or devils, at the gates of hell [not precisely - he does not picture them in the afterlife, but simply as harbingers of salvation or damnation; the text is subtle - __noise__ is what makes them devilish, __sight__ makes them angelic]; __interpretation__ - reality can be read in multiple ways [this is certainly true; the first sign is explicitly presented as ambiguous].

	- political or social stratification; the chevalier is "plus biax que dex"; the vaslez compares himself [his person] and his profession to [those of] the knights; this is the __first point of view__ presented by the poem; it models the reader's reaction and behavior [this is another problematic statement; the reader's reaction will be responding to the vaslez's point of view, but it won't be necessarily be modeled after it; in fact, the vaslez's most striking feature is his naivete, his incapacity to understand what is happening].

	- the "galois" vaslez guides the knight to the place where he has seen knights and "puceles"; the knight reveals that he had been dubbed by arthur [the knight is the first of many __teachers__ encountered by perceval; he shows him what each object is; notice that his companions misunderstand the _vaslez's_ idenity in the same way that the _vaslez_ is misunderstanding theirs; perceval's final question is "were you born like this" (genetic origin, contrasting with a cultural or pedagogical origin)].

633. [we discover that perceval was never meant to hear anything about the existence of knights; his mother would hate for him to become one of them.] the vaslez keeps asking about the court of knights and ladies. we discover that his name is "biax filz" [a provisional name]; he returns to his mother, who tells him the story of arthur and his father, uther pendragon [for whom her husband fought, and after whose death there were only poverty and tragedy; she also tells him that she prevented him from becoming a knight, unlike the rest of her family, who fell in battle]. the mode is persistently analectic [analepsis, agnition, recognition]; we discover that the valet's family often interacted with arthur's court [they were meant to be knights]. the son decides to leave; the mother __grieves__ about his departure [here chretien insists on the boy's clothing]; the vaslez wants to become a knight as well.

	- the reader becomes a knight; the mother dispenses __knowledge__ and advice, like a personification of wisdom in a vision [she insists on the value of teaching, and she reminds perceval that he hasn't received any]; she insists on the __appropriate behavior__ to hold in courtly situations [protect maidens, kiss them, and accept gifts from them], and she explains what church and sanctuary [minster] are. the character - unnamed [but he's perceval] - is a sort of __ethical tabula rasa__.

929. the vaslez leaves, leaving his mother in tears [she has actually collapsed at the bridge foot, unconscious and seemingly dead; but the vaslez ignores her distress, and rides away]. his first encounter is with a palace [actually a _pavilion_; and perceval __mistakes it for a church__] where a "dameisele" lies in bed by herself. following his mother's advice [misunderstood? misinterpreted? perceval is a sort of idiot savant; _he understands every instruction literally_], he forces the woman to receive twenty kisses; then he takes her ring. he also __eats__ and __drinks__ the "pastel de chevrel" and the wine that he finds there [__spontaneous gluttony__; the character is a sort of __savage child__], apparently another sort of __sinful satisfaction__ [another _sinful appetite_; this may be perceval's original sin, after the one against his mother].

	- after the vaslez leaves, the lord of the palace returns and discovers the outcome of his lust and gluttony; he swears revenge.

	- in the meanwhile, the vaslez finds arthur's castle; he finds the king and his knights at their table; everybody is __pensive__ and __silent__ [a sort of static tableaux; arthur is considered a _knight-maker_ by perceval; on his way to the hall, perceval ran into a knight carrying a cup stolen directly from arthur's hands; he expresses a wish to own the same armor that the knight is wearing].

1235. arthur explains the reason for their distress - their "cope" [cup] has been stolen, the queen disgraced by the wine spilled on her lap [analogy with the same sins committed by the vaslez himself]; the vaslez offers to help fetch it from the "vermauz chevaliers" [do these colors have any symbolical valence], if arthur accepts to dub him a knight [__impatient__; his "untaught youth" is now stressed]. the vaslez finds the sympathy of a _pulcele_ and the envy of kex [also called "kay the seneschal"; he seems - understandably? - annoyed by perceval's arrogance here; arthur scolds his seneschal, reiterating the contrast between a base education and a base birth]; the lady foresees a great future for him [her laughter is a sign of great things to come], but kex slaps her.

	- the vaslez faces the red knight, to get his armor [his first interest; in a way, this is another impatient __appetite__] and the cup; his weapon is the "javelot," which immediately pierces through the knight's skull [through the eye, into the brain]; the vaslez has proven his worth, but he __can't disarm the knight__ [__ignorance__; perceval is now brute force without control, strength without education]; "yonez" [Yvonet], amused by his lack of experience, helps him [but the process is incomplete; the vaslez refuses to take off his peasant clothes, his shirt, his tunic and his boots, which he prefers to the fine, rich ones worn by the red knight; he wears the armor __on top__ of his original clothes; _this moment exemplifies Perceval's current lack of allegorical education; all that he cares about is the surface, the outer layer, perhaps the literal meaning (misunderstood for a secondary meaning; but this correspondence needs further reflection)_]. the cup is given back to arthur; honor is restored. the vaslez sends yonez to arthur's court, to report his brave deed [and bring back the cup and his horse].

1531. yonez announces that the vaslez has also resolved to avenge the harmed lady [slapped by kay]; arthur wishes that the vaslez could return alive [he scolds kay; in the meanwhile, the fool predicts perceval's successes again]; but we see him wondering, until he finds a huge castle [a wonderful castle; perceval refers to his mother's teachings as he greets the nobleman who walks towards him, and questions him about his previous deeds]; the lord of the castle [actually the nobleman!] asks him about his land and his __skills__, and allows him to be hosted there. he is welcomed kindly [the servants take off his armor, revealing the peasant's clothing; then the nobleman shows him how to handle the shield, the spur, and the sword, and how to ride a horse; this teaching process, heavily emphasized and praised by the narrator, seems a sort of _unveiling_ in the case of perceval, a revelation of skills that the vaslez somehow innately possessed; the contrast between teaching and being is always active]. the lord and the vaslez begin a __pedagogical relationship__ [he is the fourth person who instructs perceval, after the first knight in the forest, the mother, and yonez]; the vaslez has to learn, and to show what he has learned; so far the whole poem has been __pedagogical__, showing the vaslez learning and using knowledge [both parts are important; but the _use_ of this knowledge is often faulty].

1827. to seal their frienship, the two characters share a __meal__ [from the same bowl], names [although perceval does not give his, he only asks for the nobleman's one - gorneman de gorhaut - as instructed by his mother], and stories [the nobleman asks the boy to remain with him for a month]. the vaslez reveals that he's still worried about his mother __fainting__ [this concern has been only latent until this point; it is as if the education was already operating, making perceval not only a better knight, but a better person], on the day when he left; the lord dubs him a knight, and gives him new advice on how to behave; he explicitly recommends to say that he, his lord [a __vavasor__], and not his mother, has instructed him [he gives him new clothes, which eventually - although reluctantly - perceval wears; he has now swapped his mother's clothes for his teacher's clothes; he teaches him to be merciful and not to kill a knight who asks for mercy; he teaches him not to speak too much; and to go to church]; the youth leaves [he is headed back to his mother]; he finds a new castle, more isolated [in a wasteland], and inhabited by a "meigre et pale" lady; the castle was once beautiful, but now it is surrounded by a waste land, and its dwellers are afflicted by a "meseise" [it is almost uninhabited; the buildings are crumbling too]; in the castle there is nothing to eat. he eventually meets the venerable lord [actually the four old retainers; __not__ a lord] and lady of the castle, whose noble fairness and elegant clothing are well described [as a desirable object; an interesting contrast with the desolation of the context].

2131. the young knight is again kindly and richly received by the lady, who is the niece of the previous lord [that is, of the vavasor]. the two dine soberly - modestly [perceval speaks very little, as instructed; but this silence impresses the lady], with the little food spared by the disease. during the night the lady cannot sleep - the youth does, soundly; she visits him by night, scantily dressed, to explain her distress and ask for help; she is threatened by an enemy, who will also __[be]siege__ her castle; he will fight for her - they swear loyalty, exchange __eros__ for __violence__, and kiss in bed all night [this moment of love was preceded by a description of perceval's almost complete contentment; all that he lacked, the narrator says, was the love of a woman, although he had not known about its pleasures yet]. the next morning, the knight repeats his oath in public [better, he displays his resolution to fight, a sort of nonverbal confirmation of the oath; the elements of romance are all here - the swearing of oaths _or pledges_, love and war].

2432. having worn his armor, the youth leaves the castle to fight against the enemy, the invader who is claiming the castle and its lady; the battle is long and slow; the youth wins it, and the enemy asks to be freed alive - he will spread the news of the knight's greatness; the youth decides to send him to arthur's court [it is his third option; the first two were the pale lady and the vavasor, but the defeated knight refused, preferring death instead; perceval is following the vavasor's instructions again, trying to be as merciful as possible], where he will be imprisoned fairly [and he will remind kay of the impending revenge]; he returns to the lady's court, where they exchange kisses and sweet words __instead of eating__ [there is nothing to eat there]; in the meanwhile, a __new enemy__ [clamadeus, the defeated knight's lord] prepares an attack [in fact a continuation of the same siege against the starving castle].

2732. the enemy summons his forces - they will take advantage of the castle's weak defenses, due to the lack of food. the two armies prepare for the battle [the initial clash ends with a success on perceval's side; it is remarkable that clamadeus, the adversary, is advised by an old counselor too]; the enemy's men remain outside; the inhabitants of the castle receive a fleet of merchants, selling food [their arrival is providential]; they feed the hungry soldiers with all they need [here we have a rich and enticing description of __food__ and __cooking__; food literally saves the day]; these are received with joy and excitement; the knight [unnamed perceval] now announces that he will fight against the enemy [he is responding to clamadeus' invitation to a single duel]; the lady tries to dissuade him with her love [in vain]. the battle [the duel] is won, and the prisoners [of the siege] are restituted [to the lady's castle, while clamadeus is sent, like his subordinate] to arthur's court.

3040. the return of the prisoners is cheered by the inhabitants of the castle. but [at arthur's court] the defeated knight, clamadex, covered in blood, relates the ferocity of his opponent [perceval] to king [arthur]; [his arrival immediately follows the one of his subordinate,] aguinguerrons.

	- clamadex is sent to arthur, who punishes him in the same way; the lady who had been beaten by kex is again promised to be avenged [and she is comforted by the news about perceval's great deeds].

	- so far, perceval has defeated aguinguerron and clamadeu [that is, after being dubbed knight, if we exclude the knight with the red armor, brutally killed by a javelot]; clamadeu has been sent to arthur to relate the bravery of percifal, and the way in which kex has been [partly, ideally] avenged.

	- percifal has triumphed [and he now enjoys the love of the pale lady of the castle, blancheflour; he may take possession of the castle, if he wanted to, and rule there happily], but his thoughts return to his mother [the vision of her fainting is a painful one; his wish is to bring her there with him].

	- perceval decides to return to his mother; he is followed by a "procession | com s'il fust jor d'ascension." [it is a festive and religious occasion - it is the narrative - the historical side of the narrative - acknowledging its religious valence, its allegorical valence; _as if perceval now was one of the angelic knights met at the beginning of his story, as if he had turned into a superhuman figure;_ the people treat him as if he was a savior - in the same way in which the prisoners of the foreign land _corresponding to hell_ saluted lancelot _in his eponymous poem_.]

	- on his way to see his mother, percefal finds two men on a boat, fishing - the setting of a __parable__ [it is a deep river that the knight cannot cross; he is looking for a way to cross it, and he knows that his mother is on the other side].

	- he is given directions to reach the house of one of them [because at the moment he wouldn't be able to cross; their boat cannot carry a man on a horse, and the only passage through the river is far away].
