#Chr√©tien de Troyes: Perceval

##Comment

20. the frame is that of an __evangelical parable__ - _the_ evangelical parable about sowing and harvesting. the "romans" is "none semance" - and in it one will find "toz le vices et toz le max" - __synecdoche__ of an ethical world. [there are two elements to justify this assumption: the reference to the parable about sowing either fertile or "worthless" ground, and the explicit recipient of text, count philip of flanders, compared to alexander - the quintessential ruler, but also the quintessential disciple; this is a book written to teach a ruler.]

305. chretien emphasizes the __ethical purpose__ of his writing - its ethical value, and effect on the reader. the tale opens in the scene - of hunting - hunters run into knights [it is actually a single hunter, _perceval_, still unnamed; he lives in the _Waste Forest_, the son of a widow, and watches harrowers and knights]. the circumstance seems that of a "vaslez" [peasant boy] mistaking a group of __beautifully armored knights__ for angels [initially for devils; _and the mistake is intensely problematic - in a way, it is an allegorical process; the boy is endowing reality with a transcendent, metaphysical layer_], welcoming him to heaven, or devils, at the gates of hell [not precisely - he does not picture them in the afterlife, but simply as harbingers of salvation or damnation; the text is subtle - __noise__ is what makes them devilish, __sight__ makes them angelic]; __interpretation__ - reality can be read in multiple ways [this is certainly true; the first sign is explicitly presented as ambiguous].

	- political or social stratification; the chevalier is "plus biax que dex"; the vaslez compares himself [his person] and his profession to [those of] the knights; this is the __first point of view__ presented by the poem; it models the reader's reaction and behavior [this is another problematic statement; the reader's reaction will be responding to the vaslez's point of view, but it won't be necessarily be modeled after it; in fact, the vaslez's most striking feature is his naivete, his incapacity to understand what is happening].

	- the "galois" vaslez guides the knight to the place where he has seen knights and "puceles"; the knight reveals that he had been dubbed by arthur [the knight is the first of many __teachers__ encountered by perceval; he shows him what each object is; notice that his companions misunderstand the _vaslez's_ idenity in the same way that the _vaslez_ is misunderstanding theirs; perceval's final question is "were you born like this" (genetic origin, contrasting with a cultural or pedagogical origin)].

633. [we discover that perceval was never meant to hear anything about the existence of knights; his mother would hate for him to become one of them.] the vaslez keeps asking about the court of knights and ladies. we discover that his name is "biax filz" [a provisional name]; he returns to his mother, who tells him the story of arthur and his father, uther pendragon [for whom her husband fought, and after whose death there were only poverty and tragedy; she also tells him that she prevented him from becoming a knight, unlike the rest of her family, who fell in battle]. the mode is persistently analectic [analepsis, agnition, recognition]; we discover that the valet's family often interacted with arthur's court [they were meant to be knights]. the son decides to leave; the mother __grieves__ about his departure [here chretien insists on the boy's clothing]; the vaslez wants to become a knight as well.

	- the reader becomes a knight; the mother dispenses __knowledge__ and advice, like a personification of wisdom in a vision [she insists on the value of teaching, and she reminds perceval that he hasn't received any]; she insists on the __appropriate behavior__ to hold in courtly situations [protect maidens, kiss them, and accept gifts from them], and she explains what church and sanctuary [minster] are. the character - unnamed [but he's perceval] - is a sort of __ethical tabula rasa__.

929. the vaslez leaves, leaving his mother in tears [she has actually collapsed at the bridge foot, unconscious and seemingly dead; but the vaslez ignores her distress, and rides away]. his first encounter is with a palace [actually a _pavilion_; and perceval __mistakes it for a church__] where a "dameisele" lies in bed by herself. following his mother's advice [misunderstood? misinterpreted? perceval is a sort of idiot savant; _he understands every instruction literally_], he forces the woman to receive twenty kisses; then he takes her ring. he also __eats__ and __drinks__ the "pastel de chevrel" and the wine that he finds there [__spontaneous gluttony__; the character is a sort of __savage child__], apparently another sort of __sinful satisfaction__ [another _sinful appetite_; this may be perceval's original sin, after the one against his mother].

	- after the vaslez leaves, the lord of the palace returns and discovers the outcome of his lust and gluttony; he swears revenge.

	- in the meanwhile, the vaslez finds arthur's castle; he finds the king and his knights at their table; everybody is __pensive__ and __silent__
