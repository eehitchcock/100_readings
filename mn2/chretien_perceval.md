#Chr√©tien de Troyes: Perceval

##Comment

20. the frame is that of an __evangelical parable__ - _the_ evangelical parable about sowing and harvesting. the "romans" is "none semance" - and in it one will find "toz le vices et toz le max" - __synecdoche__ of an ethical world. [there are two elements to justify this assumption: the reference to the parable about sowing either fertile or "worthless" ground, and the explicit recipient of text, count philip of flanders, compared to alexander - the quintessential ruler, but also the quintessential disciple; this is a book written to teach a ruler.]

305. chretien emphasizes the __ethical purpose__ of his writing - its ethical value, and effect on the reader. the tale opens in the scene - of hunting - hunters run into knights [it is actually a single hunter, _perceval_, still unnamed; he lives in the _Waste Forest_, the son of a widow, and watches harrowers and knights]. the circumstance seems that of a "vaslez" [peasant boy] mistaking a group of __beautifully armored knights__ for angels [initially for devils; _and the mistake is intensely problematic - in a way, it is an allegorical process; the boy is endowing reality with a transcendent, metaphysical layer_], welcoming him to heaven, or devils, at the gates of hell [not precisely - he does not picture them in the afterlife, but simply as harbingers of salvation or damnation; the text is subtle - __noise__ is what makes them devilish, __sight__ makes them angelic]; __interpretation__ - reality can be read in multiple ways [this is certainly true; the first sign is explicitly presented as ambiguous].

	- political or social stratification; the chevalier is "plus biax que dex"; the vaslez compares himself [his person] and his profession to [those of] the knights; this is the __first point of view__ presented by the poem; it models the reader's reaction and behavior [this is another problematic statement; the reader's reaction will be responding to the vaslez's point of view, but it won't be necessarily be modeled after it; in fact, the vaslez's most striking feature is his naivete, his incapacity to understand what is happening].

	- the "galois" vaslez guides the knight to the place where he has seen knights and "puceles"; the knight reveals that he had been dubbed by arthur [the knight is the first of many __teachers__ encountered by perceval; he shows him what each object is; notice that his companions misunderstand the _vaslez's_ idenity in the same way that the _vaslez_ is misunderstanding theirs; perceval's final question is "were you born like this" (genetic origin, contrasting with a cultural or pedagogical origin)].

633. [we discover that perceval was never meant to hear anything about the existence of knights; his mother would hate for him to become one of them.] the vaslez keeps asking about the court of knights and ladies. we discover that his name is "biax filz" [a provisional name]; he returns to his mother, who tells him the story of arthur and his father, uther pendragon [for whom her husband fought, and after whose death there were only poverty and tragedy; she also tells him that she prevented him from becoming a knight, unlike the rest of her family, who fell in battle]. the mode is persistently analectic [analepsis, agnition, recognition]; we discover that the valet's family often interacted with arthur's court [they were meant to be knights]. the son decides to leave; the mother __grieves__ about his departure [here chretien insists on the boy's clothing]; the vaslez wants to become a knight as well.

	- the reader becomes a knight; the mother dispenses __knowledge__ and advice, like a personification of wisdom in a vision [she insists on the value of teaching, and she reminds perceval that he hasn't received any]; she insists on the __appropriate behavior__ to hold in courtly situations [protect maidens, kiss them, and accept gifts from them], and she explains what church and sanctuary [minster] are. the character - unnamed [but he's perceval] - is a sort of __ethical tabula rasa__.

929. the vaslez leaves, leaving his mother in tears [she has actually collapsed at the bridge foot, unconscious and seemingly dead; but the vaslez ignores her distress, and rides away]. his first encounter is with a palace [actually a _pavilion_; and perceval __mistakes it for a church__] where a "dameisele" lies in bed by herself. following his mother's advice [misunderstood? misinterpreted? perceval is a sort of idiot savant; _he understands every instruction literally_], he forces the woman to receive twenty kisses; then he takes her ring. he also __eats__ and __drinks__ the "pastel de chevrel" and the wine that he finds there [__spontaneous gluttony__; the character is a sort of __savage child__], apparently another sort of __sinful satisfaction__ [another _sinful appetite_; this may be perceval's original sin, after the one against his mother].

	- after the vaslez leaves, the lord of the palace returns and discovers the outcome of his lust and gluttony; he swears revenge.

	- in the meanwhile, the vaslez finds arthur's castle; he finds the king and his knights at their table; everybody is __pensive__ and __silent__ [a sort of static tableaux; arthur is considered a _knight-maker_ by perceval; on his way to the hall, perceval ran into a knight carrying a cup stolen directly from arthur's hands; he expresses a wish to own the same armor that the knight is wearing].

1235. arthur explains the reason for their distress - their "cope" [cup] has been stolen, the queen disgraced by the wine spilled on her lap [analogy with the same sins committed by the vaslez himself]; the vaslez offers to help fetch it from the "vermauz chevaliers" [do these colors have any symbolical valence], if arthur accepts to dub him a knight [__impatient__; his "untaught youth" is now stressed]. the vaslez finds the sympathy of a _pulcele_ and the envy of kex [also called "kay the seneschal"; he seems - understandably? - annoyed by perceval's arrogance here; arthur scolds his seneschal, reiterating the contrast between a base education and a base birth]; the lady foresees a great future for him [her laughter is a sign of great things to come], but kex slaps her.

	- the vaslez faces the red knight, to get his armor [his first interest; in a way, this is another impatient __appetite__] and the cup; his weapon is the "javelot," which immediately pierces through the knight's skull [through the eye, into the brain]; the vaslez has proven his worth, but he __can't disarm the knight__ [__ignorance__; perceval is now brute force without control, strength without education]; "yonez" [Yvonet], amused by his lack of experience, helps him [but the process is incomplete; the vaslez refuses to take off his peasant clothes, his shirt, his tunic and his boots, which he prefers to the fine, rich ones worn by the red knight; he wears the armor __on top__ of his original clothes; _this moment exemplifies Perceval's current lack of allegorical education; all that he cares about is the surface, the outer layer, perhaps the literal meaning (misunderstood for a secondary meaning; but this correspondence needs further reflection)_]. the cup is given back to arthur; honor is restored. the vaslez sends yonez to arthur's court, to report his brave deed [and bring back the cup and his horse].

1531. yonez announces that the vaslez has also resolved to avenge the harmed lady [slapped by kay]; arthur wishes that the vaslez could return alive [he scolds kay; in the meanwhile, the fool predicts perceval's successes again]; but we see him wondering, until he finds a huge castle [a wonderful castle; perceval refers to his mother's teachings as he greets the nobleman who walks towards him, and questions him about his previous deeds]; the lord of the castle [actually the nobleman!] asks him about his land and his __skills__, and allows him to be hosted there. he is welcomed kindly [the servants take off his armor, revealing the peasant's clothing; then the nobleman shows him how to handle the shield, the spur, and the sword, and how to ride a horse; this teaching process, heavily emphasized and praised by the narrator, seems a sort of _unveiling_ in the case of perceval, a revelation of skills that the vaslez somehow innately possessed; the contrast between teaching and being is always active]. the lord and the vaslez begin a __pedagogical relationship__ [he is the fourth person who instructs perceval, after the first knight in the forest, the mother, and yonez]; the vaslez has to learn, and to show what he has learned; so far the whole poem has been __pedagogical__, showing the vaslez learning and using knowledge [both parts are important; but the _use_ of this knowledge is often faulty].

1827. to seal their frienship, the two characters share a __meal__ [from the same bowl], names [although perceval does not give his, he only asks for the nobleman's one - gorneman de gorhaut - as instructed by his mother], and stories [the nobleman asks the boy to remain with him for a month]. the vaslez reveals that he's still worried about his mother __fainting__ [this concern has been only latent until this point; it is as if the education was already operating, making perceval not only a better knight, but a better person], on the day when he left; the lord dubs him a knight, and gives him new advice on how to behave; he explicitly recommends to say that he, his lord [a __vavasor__], and not his mother, has instructed him [he gives him new clothes, which eventually - although reluctantly - perceval wears; he has now swapped his mother's clothes for his teacher's clothes; he teaches him to be merciful and not to kill a knight who asks for mercy; he teaches him not to speak too much; and to go to church]; the youth leaves [he is headed back to his mother]; he finds a new castle, more isolated [in a wasteland], and inhabited by a "meigre et pale" lady; the castle was once beautiful, but now it is surrounded by a waste land, and its dwellers are afflicted by a "meseise" [it is almost uninhabited; the buildings are crumbling too]; in the castle there is nothing to eat. he eventually meets the venerable lord [actually the four old retainers; __not__ a lord] and lady of the castle, whose noble fairness and elegant clothing are well described [as a desirable object; an interesting contrast with the desolation of the context].

2131. the young knight is again kindly and richly received by the lady, who is the niece of the previous lord [that is, of the vavasor]. the two dine soberly - modestly [perceval speaks very little, as instructed; but this silence impresses the lady], with the little food spared by the disease. during the night the lady cannot sleep - the youth does, soundly; she visits him by night, scantily dressed, to explain her distress and ask for help; she is threatened by an enemy, who will also __[be]siege__ her castle; he will fight for her - they swear loyalty, exchange __eros__ for __violence__, and kiss in bed all night [this moment of love was preceded by a description of perceval's almost complete contentment; all that he lacked, the narrator says, was the love of a woman, although he had not known about its pleasures yet]. the next morning, the knight repeats his oath in public [better, he displays his resolution to fight, a sort of nonverbal confirmation of the oath; the elements of romance are all here - the swearing of oaths _or pledges_, love and war].

2432. having worn his armor, the youth leaves the castle to fight against the enemy, the invader who is claiming the castle and its lady; the battle is long and slow; the youth wins it, and the enemy asks to be freed alive - he will spread the news of the knight's greatness; the youth decides to send him to arthur's court [it is his third option; the first two were the pale lady and the vavasor, but the defeated knight refused, preferring death instead; perceval is following the vavasor's instructions again, trying to be as merciful as possible], where he will be imprisoned fairly [and he will remind kay of the impending revenge]; he returns to the lady's court, where they exchange kisses and sweet words __instead of eating__ [there is nothing to eat there]; in the meanwhile, a __new enemy__ [clamadeus, the defeated knight's lord] prepares an attack [in fact a continuation of the same siege against the starving castle].

2732. the enemy summons his forces - they will take advantage of the castle's weak defenses, due to the lack of food. the two armies prepare for the battle [the initial clash ends with a success on perceval's side; it is remarkable that clamadeus, the adversary, is advised by an old counselor too]; the enemy's men remain outside; the inhabitants of the castle receive a fleet of merchants, selling food [their arrival is providential]; they feed the hungry soldiers with all they need [here we have a rich and enticing description of __food__ and __cooking__; food literally saves the day]; these are received with joy and excitement; the knight [unnamed perceval] now announces that he will fight against the enemy [he is responding to clamadeus' invitation to a single duel]; the lady tries to dissuade him with her love [in vain]. the battle [the duel] is won, and the prisoners [of the siege] are restituted [to the lady's castle, while clamadeus is sent, like his subordinate] to arthur's court.

3040. the return of the prisoners is cheered by the inhabitants of the castle. but [at arthur's court] the defeated knight, clamadex, covered in blood, relates the ferocity of his opponent [perceval] to king [arthur]; [his arrival immediately follows the one of his subordinate,] aguinguerrons.

	- clamadex is sent to arthur, who punishes him in the same way; the lady who had been beaten by kex is again promised to be avenged [and she is comforted by the news about perceval's great deeds].

	- so far, perceval has defeated aguinguerron and clamadeu [that is, after being dubbed knight, if we exclude the knight with the red armor, brutally killed by a javelot]; clamadeu has been sent to arthur to relate the bravery of percifal, and the way in which kex has been [partly, ideally] avenged.

	- percifal has triumphed [and he now enjoys the love of the pale lady of the castle, blancheflour; he may take possession of the castle, if he wanted to, and rule there happily], but his thoughts return to his mother [the vision of her fainting is a painful one; his wish is to bring her there with him].

	- perceval decides to return to his mother; he is followed by a "procession | com s'il fust jor d'ascension." [it is a festive and religious occasion - it is the narrative - the historical side of the narrative - acknowledging its religious valence, its allegorical valence; _as if perceval now was one of the angelic knights met at the beginning of his story, as if he had turned into a superhuman figure;_ the people treat him as if he was a savior - in the same way in which the prisoners of the foreign land _corresponding to hell_ saluted lancelot _in his eponymous poem_.]

	- on his way to see his mother, percefal finds two men on a boat, fishing - the setting of a __parable__ [it is a deep river that the knight cannot cross; he is looking for a way to cross it, and he knows that his mother is on the other side].

	- he is given directions to reach the house of one of them [because at the moment he wouldn't be able to cross; their boat cannot carry a man on a horse, and the only passage through the river is far away].

3341. the location of the palace is __elusive__ - it is an apparently empty region, and the building invisible. but __suddenly__ this is __revealed__ to him [sudden revelation; sudden apparition; the castle is massive and beautiful]; he is received in this __rich palace__, clothed by valets and welcomed by the lord [who is venerable and kind, but __unable to stand__]. perceval is given [permission to see] an extraordinary sword and a __spear__ [whose tip is permanently bleeding; more __revelation__]. among the __riches__ presented to gawain [but not given to him; he is only watching them pass from one room to the other, carried by a procession of servants], the servants display "un graal," [an ornate dish] held by the teo hands of a "dameisele" [its extraordinary features are the richness of its decoration and the exceptionally bright light that it casts on the room]. the items are moved from one room to the other; perceval is afraid to ask about them [he would like to ask __who__ eats from that dish; he is following the vavasor's instructions]; the servants prepare an ivory table, where __rich foods and drinks__ are served [but not from the graal, which instead keeps floating in front of perceval's eyes; perceval is too distracted by the food, and too afraid, to ask about it]; perceval's focus remains on the graal [at least initially], whose function and significance remain obscure. rich description of food. eventually, perceval retires to sleep [the lord cannot walk; he has to be carried away by four strong men, who hold the blanket on which he is sitting; the description is strikingly realistic].

3649. as he wakes up, perceval finds himself imprisoned in the bedroom [at least apparently; the doors to the graal's chambers are closed, no servant is around, and his objects have been moved]; the palace is silent [this _palace_ seems to operate as an __autonomous__, silent entity, as a machine - a mechanism]. having found a way out [through the doors to the hall], he only finds his horse and weapons, and leaves. he tries to find a servant, to ask for more information [about the lance; he leaves through the lowered bridge, but this is raised suddenly, as he is riding on it; apparently nobody is operating it - a mysteriously autonomous machine]. but instead he finds a "pulcele" in distress [and holding the dead body of her lover; she wonders at the healthy condition of the knight, fed and neatly arranged although there are no castles nearby]; the "pulcele" asks him about the "roi pescheor" who has hosted him [he is "the fisher king" because he has been injured and crippled long time ago, and fishing is the only activity that gives him pleasure]; the lady tells him that the fisher king has been defeated and wounded; the lady also asks him if he has seen the __wonders__: the bleeding spear and the graal. the dialogue is __swift__ - short utterances, questions and answers; the lady asks him about what he has seen and asked, like a __personification of wisdom__ [another teacher]; she is appalled by the fact that perceval did not ask nor say anything to these __fleeting apparitions__ [a proxy for interpretation; _for the hermeneutic imperative of allegory_]. here perceval __knows and reveals__, for the first time, his own __name__ ["perceval the welsh," he rightly guesses; but she corrects him again - __perceval the wretched__; if he had asked the right question, he would have healed the crippled king, restored his power, and gained much prosperity; now he is ruined]. the lady reveals that perceval's mother has died [that's the remote, actual cause of his disgrace - original sin], and that she is his __cousin__ [__agnition__]. perceval will avenge her lover, who has been killed by an evil knight; the lady also reveals the weakness of the sword [given to him by the fisher king; it has to be reforged before it can be used again, otherwise it will break immediately].

3931. the sword has to be reforged in a lake. as he proceeds on his way, perceval runs into a skinny, sad horse carrying a miserable lady, beautiful but dressed in rags [somehow unrecognizable; the embodiment of uncouth beauty]. he approaches her, asking about her state, but she rebukes his offer, telling him that he should stay __silent__; indeed, as soon as she starts explaining, her attacker, _orguilleus_, jumps into the scene, facing perceval, "come un foudre" [everything is __deceiving__ in this section - the sword is weak, the lady is a trap]. the knight, orguilleus, reveals that the lady was deceived by a "vaslez gaslois," who stole a kiss and a ring from her, and who ate some of his food; that's why she was punished; perceval reveals that he was that vaslez [and proves it by listing the foods that he has eaten there]; they fight, and perceval, having won [breaking the fisher king's sword], threatens him [to kill him if he does not forgive his wife; this is a restoration of an order; perceval is now enforcing the law using mercy and wisdom, as an agent of justice; he is not violently taking whatever he wishes].

4231. perceval spares both, and asks him to send the lady, healed and properly clothed, to arthur's court [a moral centre]. orguilleus too becomes a prisoner of arthur's; arthur and guinevere hear the story of orguilleus' mean punishment, perceval's bravery, and his firm resolution to punish kex for his effrontery [this single episode must have a strong allegorical significance; but none of the characters interrogates it directly - and its resolution is always announced, postponed somehow, but not accomplished]. arthur regrets not having recognized the unique valor of this knight; he tells again the story if his stay at his court - a __reinterpretation__ of those events [and a __repetition__ above all; chretien seldom repeats himself - the circumstance seems meaningful; perceval has now reversed his two major sins: the abandonment of his mother and the stealing of the kiss and ring] where kex is the villain and perceval the hero. [he also swears to bring the _vaslez_ back.]

	- the knights prepare a great expedition to find perceval; in the meanwhile, the hero follows the signs indicated by a hawk and a goose [potentially symbolic] - the goose was wounded [by the hawk], and bleeds [on the fresh snow]. in the drops of blood - three - left on the snow, perceval sees an echo of his beloved blanchefleur; in his contemplation he is discovered by the knights [encamped nearby].

4531. perceval cannot initially be distracted from the __contemplation__ of the three drops; he has to fight against _sagremor_ and against _keu_, who is severely wounded by the hero. [in this circumstance perceval acts almost automatically; he simply reacts to the assaults of the knights rushing towards him, similar to a mechanism, and then returns to his initial position, contemplating the drops.] keu is healed attentively by arthur's servants [and the narrator specifies that, in any case, arthur was very fond of him]; then gawain is sent to talk to the silent knight, to discover his concerns [pacifically, not violently like the previous two attempts]; gawain is the best __speaker__ [so much that keu mocks him]. in the meanwhile, two of the three drops have already vanished [dried by the sun; the passing of time, the mortality of all earthly things]; gawain and perceval become friends, and revenge against keu is discovered [again, this time to gawain].

4815. perceval is dressed finely, and received attentively. as they are celebrating perceval's arrival, an ugly woman on a mule enters the scene [arthur's hall] - __hyperbolically ugly__, between an object and an animal. she relates perceval's silent behavior at the fisher king's court, and explains that he is the cause for that kingdom's ruin. she also presents __many quests__ [corresponding to the many public troubles caused by perceval's mistake] for arthur's knights. [why should they listen to her? who is she, and why is she trustworthy? again, appearances are potentially deceiving.] gawain is the first one whom we follow; while the other knights left for their quests [and perceval has promised that he will only focus on knowing more about the grail from that moment on], he [gawaim] has been challenged by a former enemy [who claims that he has killed his lord]. his point of view [becomes ours].

5134. on his way to the quest, gawain runs into a group of knights headed to a tournament, whose occasion was especially complex. the circumstance is told in an __elaborate analexis__ [retelling and intepreting _of history, as customary_]; the occasion is the love of a lady. it is a rich description of a tournament, where the military occasion is witnessed and followed by __feminine eyes__. the women comment on the male fighters, they express their preferences; but the younger and the older sister [for whom the tournament wa arranged] disagree, and one slaps the other [an echo of keu's effrontery]; the younger sister praises gawain, while the other ladies think he's a merchant, since he is not fighting, and stays still [a misunderstanding that parallels and perhaps reverts some circumstances experienced by perceval; now the actual knight is judged superficially].

5432. gawain is received at the castle; but his character hasn't been __read__ appropriately; the ladies think that he is a __merchant of weapons__, disguised as a knight to avoid paying taxes. the lord of the house wishes to fight against him; the younger lady [who had praised him publicly] then leaves to warn gawain. gawain's [actual] host, a vassal [like the vavassor that had dubbed perceval], defends his guest;s honor against his lord [conflict of loyalties]; he is eventually persuaded of the hero's worth; gawain promises to fight for the younger lady in the tournament, to avenge her effrontery [the slap inflicted by the older sister; again an episode that parallels perceval's obsession for kay's gesture]; we eventually witness a sweet moment between the young lady and her father. he recognized the truth [about her two daughters and about gawain's worth].

5730. advised by the father, the young lady makes a __false__ longer sleeve [hers were too short for the purpose] for gawain, as a pawn for his fight [a detail that might be symbolical, and that mirrors perceval's obsession for clothing]. gawain fights bravely, and immediately defeats the older sister's favorite; in the short time of his presence on the field he collects many victories, and horses as a proze. to thank him, the young lady kisses his foot. 

	- gawain leaves to pursue new adventures; but, on his way, he hunts a white doe and makes that his horse loses one iron shoe. they find a group of people coming from a castle; a nobleman from that court invites gawain to follow them there [although the narrator anticipates that it is a country hostile to gawain].

6033. the country where gawain is led is beautiful, rich and neatly organized; a __prosperous society__, where workers cooperate for the common good [interaction between __interpretation__ and __social happiness__; literary, religious, and ethical insight provide __historical prosperity__; _abundance of commodities_]; here gawain is delivered to the nobleman's sister. here gawain behaves as a __courtly knight__; they talk about love; gawain asks for hers, and promises his; they kiss and pledge love, but their happiness is discovered by a vassal, who starts yelling against the woman; he reveals that gawain killed her father. her affection is __misplaced__. to defend himself against the upcoming attackers, gawain picks up a chessboard, as if it was a shield; he has excalibur in his hand. people and noblemen are summoned to fight against him. here chretien includes a monologue in which the lady defends herself, in contrast against the __lower classes__ [the noble lady defends the aristocratic pleasures of __courtly love__ against the people]. she thows chess pieces at them. [notice how gawain is the interpreted sign, rather than the interpreter; he has to be read correctly by the people surrounding him, because his reading is instead always fitting; it is a reversal of perceval's initial deeds.]

6330. it is a siege against the bedroom; the tower of their love. [__hospitality__ is one of the values tested in the book - one of the persistent unwritten principles.] to defend himself, the hero gawain will have to find the __bleeding spear__ [so deliberate the noblemen and the king], and deliver it to the king; he swears [that he will].

	- we now follow perceval, who lives in a state of __amnesia__ - he does no longer pray, but only looks for __fights in arms__; the __amnesia__ [think about boethius here] lasts for five years, until he runs into a procession of ladies and knights atoning for __holy friday__. they tell him about their christian faith; perceval feels contrition, and decides to follow the __signs__ left by them in the forest.

6638. crying for his sins, perceval reaches the hermit [the first one in the arthurian tradition]; he asks for confession, and explains that the source of his __forgetfulness__ is the silent reaction to the grail and the spear; the hermit adds to this another sin, which provoked the death of his mother - his departure [in a way, this is a repetition of the dialogue with the cousin]; according to the hermit, the abandonment of the mother is the cause of his silence in the presence of the grail [as if his education had been incomplete; as if the valvassor's instructions hadn't been entirely righteous; but an ambiguity remains]. the hermit explains that the grail only contains the host; no kinds of fish or food; the hermit also reveals to be his uncle - his mother's brother; then he gives him __instructions__ [he is the last teacher] for a holy life and beliefs, and a prayer to be uttered when in danger; they share a humble meal of bread and herbs.

	- the focus returns on gawain, who has left the tower of love, and on his way finds an __armor__ hanging from a tree [readable signs, wonders]; besides the tree, he finds a lady in distress, crying for her lost lover, deadly wounded in her arms, and asleep [another strong parallel with perceval's cousin]. gawain softly wakes him up; the wounded knight warns him about a mortal danger awaiting.

6943. gawain promises that he will protect the lady; he reaches a castle on the shore of a dock, rich and well protected; there he finds a beautiful lady, who is afraid of his intentions - mistaking him for a rapist [another misunderstanding; as if gawain was mistaken for perceval]. to obtain her favors, gawain leaves his horse with her and enters the city, to fetch a horse which she wants; a crowd is gathered on the other side, to dissuade him from stepping further; they scold the lady, cause of many evils; gawain also ignores the warnings of a tall knight, and brings the horse to the lady, who is still protective of the body. she is proud, and keeps teasing him; it is a game of courtly love. gawain brings a healing herb to the wounded knight, who is still alive. beyond the brige was the herb of resurrection.

7242. richness of details; the lady cuts part of her veil, to bend the knight's wounds; he revives. an ugly squire approaches her; gawain should get his horse, for the wounded knight. the squire behaves insolently, and gawain hits him; then the wounded knight tries to steal gawain's horse [gringolet]; we discover that the knight was known to gawain, and he had been punished by him for having committed __rape__ in arthur's land [__agnition, anagnorisis; analexis]. gawain has to remain with the horrid lower quality horse who belonged to the squire; this is described in detail [a nag]. gawain is moched by lady and knight; the lady follows him to a castle. [this elaborate episode of deception and appearance is perhaps the most extreme development of the theme; this time gawain has been the fallible reader.]

7530. the castle is surrounded by a deep pit, and inhabited only by __ladies__; they are richly dressed; gawain leaves the horse by the deep river [ditch] surrounding the castle, and boards a small boat chained to the deck; but there he sees an armed knight rushing towards him, to kill him; he defeats him, while the lady disappears. an embassador from the castle claims a horse from gawain, as a tribute; gawain brings him the defeated knight. the messenger, a ferryman, hosts gawain in his house, and feeds him with fowl, flesh and wine. gawain asks about the castle; its lord is unknown to the ferryman; a queen lives in it, protected by 500 bowmen.

7852. [7423] the castle is also protected by the spells of an astronomer clerk, who prevents any unworthy knight from entering the castle; the others [those who are worthy] apparently remain as servants and warriors [there is a vivid description of their __beards__ here; it is a sort of paradise]; gawain decides to visit the castle. to help him in his quest, the boatman will guide him to his destination. at the entrance they find a cripple with a golden leg; in the palace, richly decorated, they find a __wonderful bed__ [elaborate __ekphrasis__]; gawain wishes to try the bed, although the boatman tries to dissuade him. as he sits on the bed, magical arrows and traps are triggered to harm him [even a club yielding peasant and a lion]. he survives, however, and he is greeted by the servants.

8131. a crowd of ladies, all beautiful and led by a beautiful queen, visits gawain. they give him magical protective clothes. but gawain soon grows __tired__, and he refuses to __eat__ [this signals his readiness to embark in more __transcendent__ quests - _unlike perceval, who remained at the table to eat while the graal was floating in front of him_]; eventually, the queen needs him.
