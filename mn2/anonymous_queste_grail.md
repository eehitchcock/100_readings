##Ideas

- The book inserts the tradition of the mysterious sign of event that needs to be interpreted - the seat, the sword, the shield - and the very interpreter explaining its meaning to both the reader and the characters of the story; the narrator itself describes himself as an __interpreter__ of a preexisting _literary tradition_.

	- The transferable fiction is here a __parable__ that a hermit uses to enlighten Lancelot. Lancelot hears it, understands it, and transfers it to his own case.

##Comment

27. the prose is even faster than the poem. arthur's court, the day before pentecost. a lady summons lancelot and leads him to a __mysterious__ abbey, whitout telling him why. the reason, it is then revealed, is that the nuns want him to __knight__ galahad, thought to be the grandson of the fisher king.

	- at the round table, they discover the __prophetic inscription__ on the perilous seat; they also attempt to recover the sword from the stone, in vain.

	- galahad arrives, and occupies the perilous seat. he is revealed to be __lancelot's son__, and the fisher king's grandson. he also gets the sword from the stone [__agnition and predestination__].

	- lancelot realized that he is no longer the best knight; a mysterious lady announces the arrival of the __grail__ "which will feed all"; a tournament begins, to celebrate these signs.

	- as they sit to __eat__, a thunder announces the __entrance of the grail__, which floats inside the room, without carriers; it brings to each inhabitant exactly the food which he or she desires, then it vanishes; __food vessel__. the knights promise to find it and bring it back; it is a mortally dangerous quest, and it requires __abstinence__ and a __cleansed soul__.

	- galahad discovers that he is lancelot's son; they all leave for the quest.

61. we now follow __galahad__; he now gains possession of a __magical shield__, which is revealed to be an __ancient relic__ [interpretation, agnition]; a white knight explains its history; galahad then faces a __new adventure__, the scary voice that haunts a tombstone; thought to be __devilish__ at the beginning, it is then revealed to be __divine__ [misinterpretation, correct interpretation], and the __meaning__ for the entire episode is then __expounded__ in detail, as an __allegory__ for __galahad and the reader__ [is this the __template__ of what will follow?]; the same happens for meliant's fight against a powerful knight, and galahad's fight against __seven knights__; all heroes are revealed to be __sinners__; the author often refers to the __books__ that he has read to __compile the story__ [__interpretation happening at multiple levels__].

	- afterwards, galahad fights against lancelot and perceval, who do not recognize him because of his __armor__ [undreadable]; near the __forest of waste__ (from _perceval), lancelot sees the __grail__ again.

89. lancelot is in distress because he has lost the grail; to comfort him, a hermit tells him a __parable__; lancelot understands that his __love__ for guineviere is the reason for his suffering during the quest; he repents and promises to __remain chaste__ [change, pedagogy]; we now follow __perceval__, who meets the __former queen__ of the __waste land__, now impoverished; she foresees that he will have the quest; she also explains the __allegorical meaning of the round table__. perceval sees the old king mordrain, who was wounded by a vision of the grail, four hundred years before, and who is sitll waiting to be healed. Finally, perceval is attacked by a group of __mysterious knights__, and rescued by an unidentified "red knight."

123. perceval loses track of his rescuer, and loses his horse; a lady visits him in his sleep, and gives him a __diabolical horse__, which leads him to the wilderness and almost drowns him. there he also finds a lion whose cub has been stolen [the scene parallels the meeting of yvain with his animal] by a serpent; he helps the lion.

	- alone in the wilderness, perceval prays and dreams [many traits shared with the dream vision genre]; his dream is a __reflection__ of his __choice__ - to help the lion instead of the serpent. this becomes a __problem__ [interpretive and ethical]; it is then explained to be the contrast between __old and new law__ [testament]. then perceval meets a lady from the waste froest, who offers him wine and food; he promises to be hers; but then he repents this betrayal, and he is visited and comforted by the __hermit__. the narrator now follows lancelot, who is __repenting__ his sins to a hermit too; his fault was __immobility__ when seeing the holy grail.

151. the hermit now preaches to lancelot; he scorns his sin, explains a parable, presents the good behavior which he should imitate; he should __avoid meat and wine__ (diet), and go to mass daily. tired and hungry, lancelot has a vision of a flying knight; the hermit explains this vision through christian genealogy, which transforms lancelot and galahad's blood into a living relic. then lancelot fights in a tournament and loses, realizing that he is a __sinner__ [the action is only __summarily recounted__; the __outcome__ is more important than the process].

	- now we follow gawain, travelling with hector; the two fall asleep near a chapel, and they have __extraordinary visions__, which remain unexplained.

182. not having recognized his friend behind the armor [unreadable], gawain kills yvain. then the two knights find a hermit who explains and interprets their __dream visions__.

	- we now follow __bors__ [__collective quest__; collective making of meaning], who listens to the advice of a __religious man__, including recommendations about food, and a praise of the host; then he rides to a __tower__, where he is offered rich foods - which he refuses; but he agrees to fight against the enemy of the lady of the tower, although he hasn't eaten before the battle; having won, he is faced with an __ethical choice__: either save his brother, tortured to death, or rescue a lady, threatened to be raped. he chooses the lady, and his brother dies. he is then reproached for this choice; and tempted by a lady.

217. Bors is received at an abbey of monks; he is again offered food, which he refuses [this is apparently the __strongest motif__ of his adventures]; an abbot interprets his deeds; he discovers that his brother still lives; he soom meets his brother, who wants to kill him; they fight, and bors seems to succumb, until a hermit tries to stop  the brother, and is killed [the brother is an __evil man__; we doubt that saving him would have been the right choice]; the fight between the brothers is stopped by __god's voice and thunder__. god also intructs bors to meet perceval at sea; they sail away.

	- we now follow galahad, who is fighting against __gawain__ and __hector__, in a tournament; then he is guided to the ship where perceval and bors are; they __sail away together__, on the magic ship; on a second ship, they find a __magic sword__, connected to the history of the waste land; the sword is covered by __written warnings__, and it is a new relic. on the ship they also find a __wonderful bed__; here the __narrator intervenes directly in his own voice__, to explain this item and make it believable; the story of the bed begins with the __tree of life__, planted by eve after the fall from original happiness.

246. the story of the tree becomes a retelling of the old testament, and of its figures; there abel was murdered; it is a story that continues until it incorporates the present lived by arthur's knights; solomon built the magic ship and placed galahad's sword there; the sword lacked a belt, which perceval's sister provides from her hair; the three knights read about the ship's history in a letter found there. the ship then reaches the shores of a __scottish land__, where the knights find __a sieged castle__. they help the inhabitants by ferociously killing the attackers; they then witness more visions, and perceval's sister dies by performing a __miraculous healing__. afterwards, the three knights part their ways.

280. we now follow __lancelot__, who finds the enchanted ship too. there a __venerable man__ welcomes him, and prepares him for __fasting and atonement__. after days of __virtuous__ living, lancelot finds galahad, who teaches him the meaning of the bed and the sword; they live there together for six months. eventually, father and son have to part ways. on his way, lancelot finds the castle of the holy grail; there he tries to reach for the holy __table and vessel__, but he is burned by a __mysterious force__, which almost kills him. but he eventually survives; he is well fed and leaves the castle, to return to court.

	- we now follow _galahad_, who seeks and finds the __old king__, mordrain, who dies in galahad's arms, relieved. the three knights meet again, and they find the castle of the grail; there they meet the old bishop josephus, who feeds them with the __sacred food of the grail__ [mass], which is revealed to be the __platter of the last supper__. they sail back with the grail; in the city of sarras, they are imprisoned by an evil king, and stay there for a year, after which galahad becomes king. again after a year galahad dies; then perceval dies. the holy grail disappears with galahad. bors returns alone to arthur's castle, where his story is received and transcribed, as the only reward.
