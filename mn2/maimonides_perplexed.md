#Moses Maimonides: The Guide for the Perplexed

##Introduction

- moses maimoindes was born in codova in 1135; he was a descendant of those jewish communities that had transferred from the east to the west; around 1148, however, he had to leave the country, due to a change in the ruling class [the almohads, a berber muslim movement who conquered the city and abolished the dhimma] which triggered a wave of antisemitism; they [his family] settled in egipt [cairo].

	- in his youth he started writing __commentaries__ to the sacred texts; this led him to his first response to the __perplexity__ felt at the time by those jews who could not understand the ferocity of the persecutions, and [above all] who were advised to return to the __study of the scriptures__. his major work is an extensive __commentary to the torah__ [the "mishneh torah," written between 1170 and 1180], in fourteen books [and written in hebrew]; it was praised for its __insight__, but also highly __controversial__. this was followed by a __philosophical essay__ - _the guide to the perplexed_ - written in __arabic__ [judeo-arabic; that is, a dialect of arabic written in hebrew script; in 1190]; its purpose was a __conciliation__ of __reason__ (e.g. aristotle _and the kalam_) and __revelation__ (e.g., genesis _and ezekiel_). he died in 1204. [the book was then immediately translated to hebrew, by two of his contemporaries; later in latin - as the "dux neutrorum sive perplexorum" - and in spanish - as the "monstrador para turbados"; in this form it reached paris, between the xiii and the xv s., and it was read alongside averroes' works and al-ghazali's _destructio philosophorum_; it was the beginning of an intellectual unrest which eventually culminated in the __condemnations__ of aristotelian physics and averroist doctrines, between 1210 and 1277.]


- the purpose is to solve the __perplexity__ experienced by religious people [as they read the scriptures after having encountered philosophy]; its explicit project is to explain __obscure terms and figures__ found in the book of the __prophets__; but he addresses other metaphysical terms, and he explains the __system__ and __method__ of the __kalam__, the __islamic scholastic theology__.

- between the kalam and aristotle, maimonides preferred the latter; one of the __crucial problems__ was the __creation of the universe__ contained in the scriptures; for aristotle, the universe was __eternal__ [a dangerous, heretical proposition].


- in many cases, the contradictions between __science__ and __religion__ are originated by a __faulty understanding__ of the __scripture__ - especially __anthropomorphisms__ applied to god, which are explained as cases of __homonymy__.

	- in the case of __simile__, the two elements of the literary device should be first understood __separately__ [this is almost the same prescription found in hugh; the literal meaning - the thing signified - should always be present.

	- like hugh, maimonides combines his __literary handbook__ with an __ethical__ one [there are _some_ ethical recommendations; definitely not as frequent as hugh's].

	- his first purpose is that of __confuting__ the beliefs of __attributists__ - god can have no __attributes__; every adjective or verb used for god is actually __figurative__ [this is a philosophical problem as much as it is a hermeneutic - and linguistic - one; maimonides is now discussing the nature of god].

- the second task is an __argument__ about the __eternity of the universe__ based on both __sacred__ and __scientific texts__ [this dialogue is only possible thanks to the allegorical translation practiced by maimonides; maimonides has transformed the scripture into a philosophical argument; he has established a system of equivalences that transforms religion into theology, into a science that has logically connected propositions]; maimonides tries to use both at the same time, __integrating__ these perspectives; he eventually supports the side of the __creatio ex nihilo__, explaining that the passages of the scriptures that contradict this theory are, again, __figurative__, allegorical [but there is more than that; not simply the removal of potential contradictions, but the creation of a religious interlocutor; when they become figurative, these propositions allow us to understand new things about god and the universe].

- maimonides explains the operation of __prophecy__; this is a combination of __training__ and __inspiration__ [probably another practice that occurs between logic and religion; an enlightenment that is produced by faith].

- __imagination__ is a crucial factor of prophecy; therefore, prophetic texts are highly __literary__ in style [and literary _unmaking_ is the process that we use to access those truths that prophecies can reveal].

- the final part is an __interpretation__ of ezekiel's first vision [a process of literary unmaking, this time applied not to the moment of creation but to that of revelation, _god on the chariot of the tetramorphs_]; then he discusses __evil__ and __free will__.
