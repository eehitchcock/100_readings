#Lancelot

- It opens with a dedication to a "dame de Chainpagne"; some words about __praising__ her.

- The countess supposedly gave him the "matiere" for the roman; very interesting opening and premise.

- - -

1. A mysterious character appears here; his name is __Kex__ (or __Keu__ in contemp. French).

1. The interaction between the __king__ (_Arthur_) and _Kex_ is striking as well; CdT has an interesting way of imitating the mode of informal speech, even in this high context. They speak as if they were joking, for a moment.

	- The premise is noteworthy; a nameless knight visits Arthur just to remind him of a part of the land where his power has not arrived to restore order; Arthur's reaction is apparently inappropriate, so that Kex, who was eating at his table, decides to walk to him and to ask permission to leave his court (better, to resignate from the job, apparently).

	- The presence of queens and women is striking again; Arthur seems at a moment of crisis, and his only resource is the queen sitting right next to him. The queen is used as a mediatior between the king and his vassal ("seneschal"). 

	- In a way, the book therefore opens with a sense of loss and abandonment.

1. A strange power dynamic is enacted at this point. The king is dependent on both this vassal and on the queen's mediation - he has to rely on both to accomplish what he wishes.

1. __Darkness__ in this opening; sense of loss and change. They seem to be departing for a funeral.

1. __Separation__ from the very beginning - the queen's importance, and then her loss.

1. A great deal of attention is given to the __horses__ in this section. Gawain almost kills one for labor and sweat. Idea of __sacrifice__, perhaps? Of what can be __disposed__ of, although crucial (the horse, the queen)?

1. At last, we see the __charrete__, in the middle of the woods. What is happening? The man has been made the object of a torment - of a degrading form of punishment.

1. The leader of the __charrete__ is a dwarf, "un nain sor les limons [...] cuiverz de pute orine." This is, potentially, the first supernatural element of the tale (l. 352 ff.).

1. There is something even __allegorical__ about the whole thing; at the moment of deciding whether he will mount on the chariot or not, the knight experiences a conflict between __reason__ and __love__.

1. Gawain follows the mysterious __charrete__, on which he finds the knight.
