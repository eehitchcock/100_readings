##Commentary

5. the book was written as teresa, she explains in the introduction, had fallen __ill__; she had lost her hearing; the book is dedicated to __those who suffer__, to bring them __relief__.

	- the opening is immediately __metaphoric__ - she experienced "__la niebla de tristeza tenporal e humana," and therefore was brought to an __island__ called "__opprobium hominum__" [this is a reference to john's revelation, according to prof. velasco; john there refers to the literal island of _patmos_, where he has been exiled; teresa would therefore be inhabiting, again, the space of the scripture, _interpreting_ its characters as she expounds their meaning]; it is a __metaphysical landscape__ - and a __mental journey__ [she is using allegory as a means to describe a __mental__ and __affective__ condition].
	
	- we experience the problem of __visions__ - they are the embodiment of __metaphorical correspondences__; the experience of __allegory__ (textual world); she talks about a "carrera de paz" and a "poblado de placeres" - an entire geography of metaphor [it is a textual world, but also the world of interiority and earthly sensations; the metaphor stands for recognizable elements of mortal experience; visions are a _problem_ because they oscillate between these two circumstances - the physical and the metaphysical world, immanence and transcendence; pure contemplation is literal, not metaphorical; teresa is using metaphor because she is still describing her mortal experience].
	
	- she decided to remain on the __island__ - because it was good [intellectually productive, and conducive to virtue] for her; books were her guide there (david's psalms _are the first example which she provides_).
	
	- the metaphorical system is __inexhaustible__, somehow explosive; now the psalms are compared to food that has to be rationed; she explains that she will remain __lonely__, but not __otiose__; hence the book [activity in isolation; her isolation is the physical deafness and the institutional seclusion].

	- loneliness is a __literal__ and __figurative__ presence in the composition of the book [although the connection between the two layers remains problematic] - it allowed her to detach from the __distractions__ of the mortal world; __loneliness__ is the silencing of the __voices__ of the __mundane__ illusions, to hear the __scriptures__ [and allegory allows for this experiment; allegory is the sensory experience of what exists beyond the senses]; teresa sees the __hand of god__ gesturing her to be quiet; she meditates a lot on the function of __tongue__ and __voice__ (therefore, on her own __infermity__ - a sort of __miracle__ _like the ones found in berceo's collection_; _here she begins interpreting the parts, functions and behaviors of her body, attributing an allegorical significance to them_); she praises __silence__, and the physical circumstances of her illness, deafness that lets her hear more.
	
10. now teresa stages a __conversation__ with a __physically present__ god, who "__spiritually__" utters in her ear the __words of the gospels__, which she then expounds carefully; being a __contemplative__ treatise [it uses what prof. velasco would call a _prophetical method_, contrasting with the _mystical experience_ which would have been forbidden for a woman], the work is reminiscent of __boethius__. it is the same sort of __consolatory text__ - and julian of norwich - because it uses __imagery__ as an __intellectual device__ - her spiritual world becomes a __village__, outside of which one finds __sin__ and __distraction__; her __desires__ become an __animal__ which she must control with "__cabestro y freno__" - and these means are identified with her __illness and suffering__ [this is the entirety of her allegorical method in practice; her bodily experiences are integrated with the scripture, or incorporated into the scripture, to become part of a single, coherent interpretation].

	- the __argument__ employs __analogy__ and __juxtaposition__ - figures become thoughts [this will not happen in the "admiración operum dey," which is instead a strictly logical argument, like the ones constructed by the "varones" to whom it is destined].
	
16. teresa is also interpreting the images found in the __scriptures__ - "en cabestro y freno apretarás las maxillas" (jaws), from the __prophets__, becomes a meditation on the way that __illness__ and __suffering__ restrain __youth__; she uses __things__ as thoughts - as __signifiers__ - because the scriptures do the same [consider, of course, hugh of saint victor; but also dante's works; here the things that can become signifiers belong to her own body, not just to her historical identity - _and that was the heart of commedia, the idea that time and eternity, mortal and spiritual, body and soul, are linked by an allegorical - interpretive - bound_].

	- her purpose, so far, seems to be an __understanding of the reasons for her illness__; the __meaning__ of her condition - using pieces of the bible [and this is an affective project, not simply an intellectual one; allegory can _make us feel better_].
	
21. and not simply the bible, but boethius too, explicitly quoted. her question, then, is the __cardinal__ one - the __cause of suffering__, imparted to virtuous and sinful men alike [here is the consolation, not only intellectual but affective too]; the other problem is __mortal happiness__, and the pursuit of __mundane satisfaction__ [a theological problem, not simply an ethical one; the two problems are in contrast - the solution to the first one asks us to value our bodily experience, while the solution to the second one asks us to belittle its importance; physical happiness should be interpreted as insignificant; physical suffering should be interpreted as meaningful].

	- teresa uses __food__ often, as __one versatile image__ - god's banquet and the earthly banquet of pleasure, for instance; she tries to define a "__dieta__" of religious life, for a virtuous person [virtue, then, can be eaten; this is perhaps the triumph of the inversion between sensory and ultra-sensory experience - virtue becoming food]; she praises __patience__ above all; the patient and prudent man understands suffering [patience is an intellectual instrument, not simply a consolatory one].
	
28. suffering has to be understood in its __complexity__, like a large tree (with roots, trunk, and branches); its causes are deep and often __invisible__ (same for happiness and desire, found on earth).

	- teresa defines the kinds and degrees of "__prudencia__" and "__paciencia__"; patience is an __ideal of perfection__, a __virtue__ that can always be __improved__ further; she uses the __parable of the five talents__ (marcos) to explain the higher degree [there are two], associating one __element of patience__ to each talent, then doubled [that is, doubled in its allegorical connotation, or doubled in value when the higher talent is added to it; _the section is a great display of teresa's interests and technique; she uses the most explicitly "materialistic" among the parables, and asks us to transform that concrete system of transactions - and enrichment - into a metaphorical one, where the multiplication of physical goods - tokens, signifiers - corresponds to a multiplication of meanings - a doubling that is the doubling of allegory, but also an allegorical doubling - within a metaphysical context].
	
38. the doubling of the talents occurs because we have to gain __more virtue__ through virtue - "amor syngular" has to __produce__ (as an __economical gain__, where virtue, money, and signifiers - _language, a system of currencies _ interact in the same way) "amor reverençial"; the doubling is an application of the allegorical method to virtue itself, and its objects - these can be __made transcendent__, spiritual - these can signify something else, or be attached to something else. one can endure __physical__ pains, but also __spiritual__ ones - the sins and their __temptations__; the endurance of spiritual evils is the __allegorical, secondary talent__ - its __figura__ of __perfectibility__ [the connection is always figurative]; teresa discusses the __seven sins__ (__spiritual illness__, _contrasting with the physical illness that is endured by the first layer of virtue_) and their __remedies__.

	- in the section devoted to the talent of __mortification__, which is first __corporal__, then __mental__ (here the dichotomy seems as simple as __concrete__/__abstract__), __human thought__ is compared to a __dromedary__, which moves __swiftly__ and __freely__, ans should instead be constrained and slowed down.
	
	- the first talent, __physical__, is always the means to achieve the second, __ideal__ [it has to be __invested__ in order to produce profit; again, the notion is then extended not only to the economical sense, but also to the linguistic investment required by allegory - where the _literal_ has to be _invested_ to gain the _figurative_ - and the moral investment required by virtue].
	
44. to exterior passion corresponds an inner passion [the __ground__ is passion; physical passion experienced in the mortal world, and figurative passion experienced through writing, the affective response modeled by the text, or signified by the text]; in the conclusion of the section, the body corresponds to the soul (__the body is a signifier for the soul__ - allegory here becomes theologically explosive), and teresa returns to the subject of (her, and everybody else's) __physical illness__.

	- in the following section, teresa contrasts __peter lombard__ (_the master of sentences_, his _Libri Quattuor Sententiarum_ being the standard textbook for theology) and __job__ (_the master of patience_), favoring the latter's book [and praising his experience; lombard here stands for the world of intellectual contemplation, and for learning as a means to achieve virtue, whereas job achieved virtue by suffering physical pains - through bodily endurance and his mortal life; for teresa the textbook written by job is his own life, each grief a sign].
	
49. __patience__ is the supreme teaching, teresa seems to imply; it is the basis of the four virtues, and the virtue that should always be asked [in prayer] or sought [in life; rather than relief from suffering one should ask for patience to endure them]; __patience__ leads to virtue [ethical] and god [intellectual and spiritual].
