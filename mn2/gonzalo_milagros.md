#Gonzalo de Berceo: Milagros de Nuestra Señora

##Introduction

- gonzalo was born around 1196 in berceo (north-east of spain); he became a clerk, then a deacon; he would, therefore, be an ideal representative of the _mester de clerecía_.

- the poems of the milagros all have __latin antecedents__ - with the exception of the "iglesia robada," possibly his addition; the genre is that of __hagiography__ [not quite], combined with __exempla__ [more likely; the book has more affinities with marie de france or chaucer than with a canonical hagiographical book].

- gonzalo introduced __liveliness__ and __dialogue__ in his version of the collection [paradoxical realism].

- among the possible reasons for the composition of the work
