#La versión castellana medieval de la Epitoma Rei Militaris - Alfonso de S. Cristóbal

##Introduction

- vegecio escribió la "epitoma" entre 383 y 450 (fifty years before boethius); it is a work in four of five books [depending on the edition]. one describes the __recruitment and training of troops__, with notes about encampments; the second one describes the __organization of legions__ in the past; the third is about the preparation and execution of __battles__; the fourth one describes __sieges__ and __naval battles__.

- the text was translated __eighteen times__ between 1272 and 1475 - in __six different vernaculars__. one of the translators is __jean de meun__ (1284); the others are in italian, german, english, catalan, spanish.

- the spanish version by san cristóbal was completed between the __xiv__ and the __xv__ s.; it is the only __complete and direct translation__ from the __latin original__; it survives in __seven mss__.

- like the __eneida__ by enrique de villena (written for the king of navarra), this translation was dedicated to a __sovereign__ - either enrique iii or enrique iv (__king of castilla león__ between  xiv and xv).

- the translation is generally __accurate__, and its choices well justified.

- the translation features __two set of glosses__ - __explicative__ and __spiritual__; these ran alongside the entire text, whose actual layout is still debated (either __vertical__ or __horizontal__).
