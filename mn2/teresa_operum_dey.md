##Ideas

- In this work Teresa is linking her body to the form of her writing, to its meaning in a broader context. Like for _Cite des dames_, men are blamed for their poor interpretations - in this case, they misinterpret women as a physical sign.

	- Her argument is that precisely her weakness - like her deafness - allows her to write.

##Introduction

- the work is an __apology__ of the previous book, where teresa defends herself from accuses of __lack of originality__; she explains the importance of her __personal experience__ and __readings__ [she also rejects a series of sexist accusations].

##Commentary

54. in the preface, teresa justifies the delay with which she is presenting this work by reminding its recipient [a woman as well] of her __suffering__ and __endurance__ [which are also __moral qualities__ for teresa], both physical and spiritual; the method hasn't changed - the __material world__ not only affects, but it __means__ or __resembles__ [it _signifies_] the __spiritual one__.

	- a __feminist__ problem is introduced subtly - teresa refers to her wits as __weak__ and __frail__, because they are __feminine__; her body, therefore, is not only __affecting__, but also __gendering__ her mind and soul [her body, being feminine, _means_ a feminine soul; teresa cannot escape this contradiction].
	
	- __flaco mugeril entendimiento__ finds the opposition of the "_prudentes varones_" who read it; it is a __gendered relationship__ between __author__ and __audience__; the varones see a contradiction between the __writing__ and the __writer__ - a petty ill thing - a deaf woman - cannot contain anything good; we assume that her answer may be - "you cannot read these __signs__ well enough."
	
	- her first __objection__ is that god multiplies __loaves and fish__, and multiplication of small petty things is a __principle of nature__ [again - the natural, mortal world and the figurative world of the scripture are integrated in teresa's rhetoric]; the second is that we cannot understand why or how god created a __difference__ between men and women - it is an __unreadable sign__ [which means that reality, _perhaps like the scripture_, still possesses mysteries that are impervious to interpretation]; but, she says, strong and brave men __complement__ weak and trepid women, like the __bark of a tree__ complements the __core__ (_notice_ that the same image was used by berceo to contrast __signifier__ - __literal__, the bark - and __signified__ - __figurative__, the core; _it is, again, a fusion of observations drawn from the physical natural world and the cognitive - literary - method of allegory; she uses both the example of nature and a codified image about metaphor_]; women are also the __inner__, more spiritual part of mankind; but teresa doesn't insist too much on this point, and she returns to __inscrutable__ providence [that is, even if we could use this analogy, god's decisions are still inaccessible - nevertheless, she has already set out the criterion - it is either natural observation or the system of correspondences found in the scripture and in its allegorical interpretation].
	
60. the __example of judith__, who slew the intimidating holopherne [whom no man could face], is used to prove that god often graces women with __extraordinary talents__ [and talents are, of course, a cardinal concept for teresa, as the arboleda has shown].

	- teresa then discusses the case of __wonder__ - which is what her decision and determination to write have caused [but it is a bad sort of wonder; somewhat _skeptical_, not supported by faith]; her __male readers__ should be careful about the things that they wonder about - wonder is, too, a form of __divine contemplation__; the first object of this __contemplation__ - or wonder - ought to be __grace__; the gifts of grace are superior to those of nature, and they often compensate for the flaws of nature [here teresa's prose is a __strictly logical argument__ - _it uses abstractions and logical connections, not figures - like personifications - and analogies_]; not only god graced her with __knowledge__, but __knowledge__ and __intellectual abilities__ are always __gifts of grace__ - every human's nature is so flawed as to require god's enlightenment [and the double signification of allegory, always associated to the observation of nature]; god is the sole dispenser of virtue, for all [women and men are similarly dissimilar from god].
	
65. the same argument is used against the accusation of __plagiarism__ - only god inspired and instructed her; to explain the circumstance, she uses the episode of a __blind man on the road to jericho__ [in mark, matthew, and luke] - she __interprets__ the episode, __dramatizing__ it from the perspective of the blind man; we have her __dialogue__ with god - and the scripture [another recurrent and productive method for teresa]; she explains that the blind man is her __understanding__ [his blindness is also her deafness, arguably - _but remember that in the alboreda sensory incapacity equated ultra-sensory perceptiveness_]; she expounds the __parable__, returning to the beginning of her first book - the __physical deafness__ that paradoxically stands for a __heightened__ spiritual perception [the principle remains the same - god's voice will speak to her spiritual ear, because it is the only voice that she can hear].

	- in the final section, teresa conflates her images suggesting a strongly feminist perspective - her __understanding__, sensorily deprived [the blind man in jericho], is like __a woman locked in her house__ (therefore, like the core beyond the strong bark; _but also like herself, locked in the seclusion of the convent_); this final move justifies her decision and ability to write, both as a __woman__ and as a deaf person, beyond the argument about grace; her __social and physical marginality__ is the __perfect condition__ for __divine wonder__.
