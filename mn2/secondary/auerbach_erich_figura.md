#Erich Auerbach: Figura

|Key-words|Concepts|
|:---:|:---:|
|Literal meaning; Typology|By analyzing the history of the word _figura_, Auerbach shows how typology allowed Medieval thinkers to incorporate and connect diverse historical events by making one the _fulfillment_ of the other.|

##1. from terence to quintilian

- auerbach starts by tracing the __origin__ of the latin word, whose original meaning was "three-dimensional shape"; its first use is in terence; it is immediately associated with the idea of __change__ and __novelty__ ("_figura nova_"); the meaning of the word broadened because of the contact of roman language with greek philosophy - the greeks had __more words for shape__' figura became a __polysemous signifier__ (it meant form, imprint, picture...), malleable in its __connotations__; for lucretius it occasionally means "copy," and even "atom"; cicero is the first to use it for __linguistic style__; in the imperial period it is then used richly [extensively], often with the idea of __phantom__; it is eventually used as "appearance."

	- quintilian is the first to use it for __rhetorical figures__ - as a __general hyperonym__.
	
##2. figura as historically real prophecy in the texts of the church fathers

- tertullian (155 - 240) is the first writer to use the word in a christian context, for instance when referring to the prophetic presence of a jesus/jehousha in the old testament; here "__figura__" comes to signify "something __real and historical__ that __represents and proclaims in advance__ something else that is also __real and historical__" [time and reality are the cardinal components of this definition]; it is a reciprocal relationship based on __accord and similarity__.

	- it is important to notice that both events are "__literally and really true__" - tertullian believes in the __historical accuracy__ of both __figure__ (__old testament__) and __fulfillment__ (__new testament__); he uses __figura__ to refer to the bread and wine of the transubstantiation as the "__figura corporis__" and "__sanguinis__"; at times the __figura__ is "__umbra__," and the __fulfillment__ "__veritas__" - but both are always real in the world, not abstract.
	
	- tertullian's understanding of the concept became widespread in the iv s.; but at times we find __more intensely allegorical__ or __spiritual__ readings [of __figura__, that is, of the relationship between old and new testament], such as __origen__ [described by henri de lubac as the originator of every method of figural reading]; at times the __historical meaning__ of the scripture was, in fact, close to "evaporating." agustine was responsible for their __reconciliation__; he used figura in its many meanings; he also prominently hinted at a __three-step__ understanding of __figura__ - the old testament, the new, and the eternal time beyond time of the kingdom of heaven.
	
	- __rite__ and __moral behavior__ are ways to make __figura__ in the present, by following the __ethical__, __tropological__ instructions contained in the __scripture__.
	
	- for augustine the premise is god's distance from the perception of __differentia temporis__ - figures are __timeless__ [consider boethius' discussion of time and the chariot hitting the man in the street].
	
	- the metaphorical use of __figura__ mixed with its literal sense of "shape"; at times it expressed the __intermediate step__ between __historia__ and __veritas__; it surpassed allegoria and typus.
	
##3. the origin of figural interpretation and analysis

- here auerbach wants to distinguish the rhetorical meaning of figura from the rest; the __origin__ of the concept is __paul__ - the __typological__ reading of __hagar__ and __ismael__ against __sarah__ and __isaac__, and the discussion of __circumcision__ and __diet__ (all discussed in __nirenberg__, _where the two couples stand for two antithetical approaches to the text, literal and figurative understanding; it is an allegory used to describe the readability of allegory itself_); auerbach justifies this frequent use of typology as a __missionary__ necessity; paul's intention was to _separate_ __law__ from __grace__, to explain that obedience to the old jewish law was "pointless, even harmful" [this is the intersection between __tropology__ and __legal systems__]; it was paul's way to __both confirm and reject__ the old testament - a strong __political tool__.

	- it was also one of the most powerful ideas of christianity - its way to maintain both a __historical__ and __transhistorical__ aspect - christianity was transcending the national boundaries of the middle east, the region which first received its contents, and its culture [it was no longer a solely jewish discovery; that is why _figura_ has this missionary connotation - it was used to make these teaching and principles applicable to a wider context].

	- the double historical reality of figura (both its tenor and its vehicle) distinguishes it from forms of allegory where one meaning remains spiritual [we can find a contradiction here - paul was both __incorporating__ and __rejecting__ the material necessity of jewish rituals - such as the bodily sign of __circumcision__; in the new order, christians do not need __material signifiers__ - isn't this in contrast with the perspective adopted by auerbach here? _not exactly; material signifiers used in the past are figura for the spiritual truth found now; they are real and meaningful, but their fulfillment happens only in the spiritual context of christianity_].

	- __spiritual readings__ were applied to __historical events__ and to the __natural world__, depriving them of their __historical importance__ or even __consistency__; figura remained the most influential one; auerbach briefly touches on __symbols__ as well - these are __magical signifiers__ whose origins are somehow __obscure__.

	- the notion of __figura__ endows every historical event with a sense of __incompleteness__ and __promise__; time is __vertical__, and determined by __analogy__ - not __causality__; all figures, and all events - are also __permanently fulfilled__ in god's knowledge; the last supper is its quintessence [the figure of transubstantiation; it is jesus performing a jewish ritual to prefigure his death, and its fulfillment in eternity].

##4. on figural representation in the middle ages

- auerbach emphasizes that the difference between __figura__ and __allegory__ is crucial, and should always be kept in mind; he also reminds us that the middle ages saw figural connections between the __trinity__ and __man__; between __god__ the __creator__ and man the __artist__ (a __neoplatonic__ idea too; _and a powerful one; writers and artists would be constantly prefiguring god's act of creation; consider the york cycle, but who knows how many other works - pearl?_).

	- auerbach wishes to prove that figura is the leading __political__ - __creative__ device of the __commedia__; cato's mortal life and suicide, for instance, is a figure of his freedom in __purgatory__ (notice the __common ground__ - the word "freedom" - between __vehicle__ and __tenor__); vergil is both dante's human friend and a __figura__ of __reason__; in __vita nova__, his own life is __figura__.
