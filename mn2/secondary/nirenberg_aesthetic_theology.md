#Aesthetic theology and its enemies - David Nirenberg

##Introduction

- the __axial age__ [term coined by karl jaspers to refer to the centuries going from viii to iii s. b. c.] is the era when humanity discovers religion and transcendence; its main components are __skepticism__ - the knowledge that __human senses__ are __limited__ and __transient__ - and __transcendent__ [thought] - the belief that truth exists truth exists __beyond__ the mortal world.

	- for thinkers like __plato__, the __human being__ is __split__ between these two realms - eternity and temporality, transcendence and immanence; the human soul would be eternal; the body only a fleeting - and __deceiving__ - vessel.

	- __christianity__ has affinities with platonism [it is important to remember, however, that - according to prof. velasco - neoplatonism ended with john of salisbury, between canterbury and __chartres__ - the last center of neoplatonic philosophy - in 1180]; its goal is often __skepticism__ in the mortal world, and __faith__ in the transcendent one.

	- the example quoted by __nirenberg__ is related to __food__ - it is found in luke 12:1-2, and it concerns __bread and yeast__, both understood once __figuratively__, and once __literally__ (what is the __yeast__? _this question still requires an answer; jesus, in fact, does not provide a satisfactory equivalent for this signifier; we are left, like the apostles, without a precise answer_); the apostles here were distracted by __hunger__; nirenberg claims that the same confusion surrounds __judaism__ - literally a religion, and symbolically a __lack of understanding__ - an erroneous interpretive disposition (those who could / cannot understand; _the idea resonates with almost every anti-semitic text produced in england since s. xiii, including chaucer and perhaps the merchant of venice_).

	- the thesis of the book is that __christian culture__ has been shaped by its perception of the "jew."

	- nirenberg describes how hellenism, propagated by alexander's army, was a system of transcendent thought; when it reached the jewish world, which was also a transcendent world, jewish intellectuals, like philo [of alexandria, a contemporary of jesus; _he used philosophical allegory to harmonize greek philosophy and jewish religion; in a way, a predecessor of maimonides_], appropriated that method and vocabulary to study the interpretation of the bible.

	- later, paul transformed the __religious difference__ between jews and christians into __aesthetic differences__ [in perception and interpretation]; for paul the jews were not able to read and understand jesus' actions properly because they were focusing on the __mortal__, or __carnal__ side, not on the __spiritual__ - or __transcendent__ - side (that is why paul recommends __avoiding__ circumcision - christians do not need __bodily signifiers__ - same for the __diet__) .

	- for nirenberg, __allegory__ was an instrument used by paul to turn the difference between __body__ and __soul__ (or between __material__ and __spiritual__ interpretation; _again we have an unchallenged use of platonic ideas and terminology_) into the difference between __christian__ and __jews__ (the latter being __unable to read allegorically__; _allegory being the shibboleth required to understand the distinction - both the exclusion and the exclusive principle; exclusivity defines an identity and a set of meaning understandable or conceivable for that identity_); finally, nirenberg reminds us that this __anxiety__ about judaism concerned __christian behaviors and beliefs__ - not jews [and actual jewish beliefs]; he also refers to the theories of nazi germany to remind us that these conceits are not necessary [they are culturally and historically determined; they should not be considered a necessity - an integral part of cultural definitions tout court].

##Chapter one

- nirenberg first addresses the problem of __idolatry__ - __images__ were forbidden in jewish culture; the same idea is found in plato's rejection of __mimesis__; later, paul would ambiguosly ground two __antithetical stances__ on the matter - the __rejection__ of images as __deceiving__ and its paradoxical appreciation as a way to approach a deeper knowledge of the divine [__iconoclasm__ and __idolatry__; "judaism" would be referred to the two extreme attitudes].

	- the first debates concerning the place of images in __christian liturgy__ used "judaism" to oppose both positions - the worshippers of images and their destroyers (a relevant episode is found in gonzalo's milagros, where the jews both __misinterpret__ the signifier and __destroy__ it - a clumsy form of iconoclasm; _nirenberg in fact refers to similar episodes as part of a broader anti-semitic tradition_].

	- the first example of __painted prejudice__ described by n. is an illuminated book by __alfonso el sabio__ [1221-1284] - __cantigas de santa maria__; here we find an iconoclast jew, shitting on a portrait of mary; a paradoxical symbol of belief in it [the craxton tale of the sacrament works similarly].
