#Comment

- _Introduction_

	- velasco starts by describing the __pervasiveness__ of __fiction__; while history, science and theology were trying to get rid of its influence, __medieval law__ turned it into the __core of its creative faculty__.

	- fiction and the law were interacting on the __margins__ of books; fiction always had to be matched by __aequitas__ - equity.

	- the space where fiction operates is in the __margins__ of the book; in this space and with this lens, velasco explores the __translation of power__ from the aristocracy to the __mercantile class__ (xii-xv).

- _Una industria en el margen_

	- velasco starts by expanding the ways that the __margins__ at times __displace__ the center of the page, subverting the __hierarchy__ of both __content__ and __layout__ (__ordinatio__),

	- velasco explains the transformations in the process of __ordinatio__ that occurred in the __xii s.__; from this moment to the __xv__ s., the development of __ordinatio__ coincides with that of __marginal writing__.

	- the specific case study analyzed by velasco is that of the "__glossa ordinaria__" to the corpus iuris civilis compiled about the __xiii s.__ in bologna, and comprising about __one hundred thousand glosses__.

	- these glosses originally developed as the __transcription of annotations__ collected during __university courses__ in law (the creator of the __method__ is accursio); through this process, the ancient __roman law__ could be __adapted to contemporary italy__ and its needs.

	- here velasco introduces the difference between __nobleza del estado__, embodied by _accursio_, and the _margenes plebeyos_ with which he works; in the __margins__ the assimilation of nobility by the __urban middle class__ occurred.

	- the process began in italy, but it had its first concrete culmination in the __siete partidas__ of castilla; there it also became a cardinal means of monarchic control over the state.

- _Accion util de la ficcion_

	- here velasco describes the __increasing importance__ of the __fictio legis__ in the middle ages, when it became the main __heuristic and epistemological__ instrument of legal science; the principle is that __something that is clearly false__ is assumed to be __true__; it became the core of "__naturaleza__."

	- with the siete partidas we encounter the distinction between "natura," the thing in itself," and "naturaleza," something that resembles __natura__, but that it is not; and here velasco provides a good example: in __natura__ every man is born __free__; in __naturaleza__, some men are born __slaves__, others free.

	- the __domain of the fictio legis__- that of what is possible in the realm of _language_, though not in reality, was often in the process of being __denied__ and __limited__.

	- velasco is interested in the way that __legal language__ occasionally __permeates__ literary works such as berceo's "_milagros_"; __miracles__ are especially fecund for this overlap, since they often require a moment of __trial__ to assess their __status__ (both are moments of __linguistic appropriation of reality__).

	- the transformation of fiction that occurs in the margins is exemplified by the __fictio legis corneliae__, where a __captive woman__ gives birth to a __child__ who has some rights "_as if he was born in his own home_."

	- these _fictiones_ are __literary models__ that seem __abstract and disembodied__; they are systems of __transformation of reality__ (linguistic systems), and they are __empty__ until the moment of a __trial__.

	- at times these fictions can acquire, still in the domain of __disembodied hypothesis__ further __detail and plot complexity__; at times they __incorporate__ specific __examples__ (stories that have to be __emptied__ from circumstantial referents); his is called "__enplotment__."

	- at times, the __exempla__ are __actual fictions__, featuring __fictional names__ and __paradoxical circumstances__ (e.g., an island that suddenly appears in the sea, or in a river); some of these __marginal fictions__ slowly become __less abstract__, incorporating __familiar spaces and circumstances__ (e.g., a sevillan soldier), and slowly __transforming reality__.

- _Ciencia de la literatura_

	- to enrich his analysis, velasco introduces two concepts: the "poetica de lo plebeyo" and the use of __specific women__; in both cases we find a theorization of __new social roles__ that, like the __legal fictiones__, was produced between the concrete, particular case, and the __abstract, "disembodied" principle__ (the problem is __synecdoche__, which might also be considered a form of __allegoria__).

	- the __circumstance__ analyzed by __velasco__ at this point is the __appropriation__ of __politcal discourse__ by __legal language__; the author is _bortolo di sassoferrato_ (1313-1357; in his commentaries we find __fictiones__ concerning the definition of __nobility__, which is hypothized not in __genetic__ or __theological__ terms, but as a __civil__, political category; bartolo underlines how __nobility__ and "__plebeyans__" are only separated by time.

	- velasco eventually focuses on the __marginal discussion__ of a plebeyan woman in boccaccio's "_de casibus_"; boccaccio is employing the margin in poetry, following the tradition of __legal glossing__, and he is using a genre that seems strictly connected to the __fictiones__ - that of the __exempla__.

	- boccaccio would also be contending that poetry needs to be included among the arts that produce profit in this new economical setting.

	- the __biographical genre__ becomes a form of exemplum, a __fictio legis__.

- _Conclusion_

	- the focus of the work is "the moment when the industry of the margins of law and its peculiar theory of fiction becomes a __point of reference__ for a project where the detachment of __literary activity__ from a __domestic domain__ to a knowledge of __literary science__ is proposed.
