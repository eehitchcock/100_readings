#Res et significatio: The material sense of things in the middle ages - A. Kumler

5. the authors introduce the popularity of __materiality__ in contemporary medieval studies; __materiality__ is a given for art historians - but not __tangibility__ [they are mostly concerned with the visual aspects of art]; this is the __new frontier__; as a new approach to the problem, the author suggests the __dingbedeutung__ theory first proposed by __friedrich ohly__.

	- ohly belongs to the generations of european scholars - and medievalists - affected by the world wars; his first work was an analysis of the __history__ of the interpretation of the __song of songs__.

	- ohly's major work was a study of the way in which __signifiers__ can be __things__ - and __things__ can be __signifiers__, even in the context of __philology__ and __textual exegesis__; the __verbal sound__ was an evocation of the __material__, empirical world of things [_oral connection_; the thing in your mouth stands for the thing outside of it - _resembles_ the thing outside of it] - and these things could be interpreted in a wider hermeneutic process [the injunction to consider the __materiality of things__ for the __interpretation of scripture__ is found in __augustine__; the same idea is exposed poetically in alain de lille's _omnis mundi creatura_ - it is an invitation to attentively study the empirical world].

	- the main obstacle for the interpretation of the material world was its __endless polysemy__ [__not its opacity__; this is a cardinal distinction]; every __sense__ [that is, every sensorial experience of a thing] had __meaning__.

10. the authors discuss elements not __satisfactorily__ analyzed by ohly - such as the __many connotations of color__ in illuminations; the authors then suggest an __interpretive method__ focused on the interactions between __text__ and __images__ (_in manuscript tradition_; and between __both__ and the __thing__ which they depict or name; e.g. - if a dove has black feet [in an image] instead of red [in reality] - what matters? _how do we interpret the differences between the referent-thing and the referent-idea - the way in which an object has been depicted?_).

15. ohly apparently worked extensively on the interpretation of the __pavement of siena's duomo__; the authors suggest that the __arrangement of the images__ creates a series of __typological correspondences__, achieved through __architectural space__; old an new testament [are materialized in the two sections of the church, entrance and altar].
