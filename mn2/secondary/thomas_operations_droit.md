|Trial; Figurative meaning; Fictions|Yan Thomas analyzes the creative role of the _fictio legis_ in Roman and Medieval law; this powerful linguistic operator, which had transformative power on reality, was opposed by Christian thinkers.|

##Introduction

- this is a collection of papers concerning __roman law__ - considered from a __dynamic__, historical perspective, as something __malleable__; his __method__ allows us to understand __law__ ("right") as an anthropological method - a description of the interactions between __individuals__ and __objects__.

	- the four corners of this theory [rather, of the problem of roman law as a whole] are __nature__, __institution__, __case__, and __fiction__; the three __circles__ are __living beings__, __human beings__, and __urban institutions__ (from __nature__ to __city__); one of its main dichotomies is __nominalism__ against __materialism__.
	
	- the cardinal historical event, for thomas, is the __foundation__ of the __city__ [here it is rome, but not only rome].

	- another cardinal notion is that of "__fictio legis__" - the __fiction__ of the world which supplanted the __actual world__ in the operations of roman law, and was then replaced by "__natural law__" in the __middle ages__ [nature being arguably another fiction; _fictio legis is a simulation - an "as if"_].
	
##Commentary

###Première partie: Les artifices de l'institution: le cité, la nature

1. "L'institution juridique de la nature: Remarques sur la causistique du droit naturel à Rome"

	- the chapter begins by presenting the three circles of __roman law__ - living animate beings [animals], humans, and cities; __cities__ are the products of __wars__ (that is, of __history__) - __natural law__, __human law__, __civil law__ (human law concerns the __nations__); but these boundaries are problematic and flexible; __natural right__, for instance, has a very __limited scope__, and its __separation__ from civil right has to be persistently reiterated and __justified__ [the same sort of _violence_ that _makes the human_ - juridically as well? - different from the animal]; __property__ is, for instance, something that has to be __created outside of nature__ - a __change in state__ that occurs in various ways (naming, killing, writing); slavery similarly concerns __property__ and __nature__; an analogous problem is posed by __adoption__ - fictive __genealogy__; it is a __fiction__ of __nature__ [adoption is one of the canonical examples of _fictio legis_ - the person is related to me _as if_ it was my son].
	
2. "L'institution de l'origine: Sacra principiorum populi romani"

	- the chapter is concerned with the __foundation__ of the first roman nucleus, "lavinium," considered a __sacred event__; how was this sacredness instituted?
	
	- thomas analyzes the etymology of __penates__, the ancient roman gods, to establish their relationship with __penetration__ and the creation of an __inside space__; indeed, the gods seem connected with the creation of __architectural spaces__ - and a __city distinct__ from rome, a __symbolic space__ to which return is possible [although it is not accomplished; _this notion is a fictio legis as well; it is a fictional institution - a fictional space - that has a real impact on society; probably a notion familiar to christine as she wrote the _cité des dames_ - and perhaps to augustine before her?].
	
3. "Idées Romanes sur l'origine et la transmission du droit"

	- here thomas analyzes the __myths__ with which romans explained the __origins__ of their __legal system__; these are associated either with the city or with the deceased person of __numa__, who left his writings as a guide for the posterity (again, a physical artifact, not a living - dynamic - individual; _numa is incapable of responding; is thomas implying that this fiction and the one about the city belong to the same category?); somehow, the law belonged to the dead; it is __impersonal__ and __written__, founded together with the city walls.
	
4. "De la sanction et de la sainteté des lois à Rome: Remarques sur l'institution juridique de l'inviolabilité"

	- the chapter starts by describing how roman laws clearly __distinguished__ between __norm__ (what ought to be done) and __punishment__ (the __sanction__ resulting from violating the norm); the whole conversation is entirely __linguistic__; the idea is that, by dividing the two, roman law does not even acknowledge the existence of __behaviors__ that do not conform with it - it is a __perfect law__; its violation - sanction - is a violation of __sanctity__ - __holiness__; the law is __autonomous__ - and it denies all alternatives (everything that exists outside the law, and everything imposed by other laws).
	
5. "L'institution civile de la cité"

	- the problem of the cities is the problem of __groups__ behaving - and __acting juridically__ - like __individuals__; cities have __properties__ and __rights__; cities become [like] persons - they own specific boundaries and features (personification); here thomas describes the __paradox__ of the __abandoned city__ - which still exists, arguably, as a __nominal entity__ - in the one citizen that survives - he is the city [tenor and vehicle become one].
	
	- here thomas poses a new __linguistic__ problem - the city __cannot be identified__ with a person in roman law; yet, it behaves like one [or it can be one]; it is a __state__ of __in-betweenness__ - of impossible reconciliation between signifiers and signifieds; the solution to the issue was often __purely linguistic__ [it is a linguistic object - an "as if" - that has actual social and legal consistency; it becomes an _object_, with features and rights; "as if" the city was a person - the city is now, like a metaphor, between one entity and the other - city and person, tenor and vehicle].

###Seconde partie: Les artifices de la verité: la fiction, le temps

6. "Fictio legis: L'empire de la fiction romaine et ses limites médievales"

	- thomas starts by defining the __domain of fiction__; fiction is, by definition, __falsehood__ - falsehood interpreted as __truth__ [_as if_].
	
	- in roman law, fiction had a __transformative power__; its __linguistic method__ is the __hypothetical mode__; it hypothesizes __negative circumstances__ - things that happened, as if they wouldn't have happened; and positive ones (__creation__ and __destruction__ of reality; _the law can either consider or not consider real objects; a captive man is "as if" dead - destroyed; _).
	
	- medieval law attempted to contrast the method of fiction, founding its premises on __facts__ - as far as possible; the reliance of roman law on fictional circumstances was highly problematic for christian commentators, for whom nature was __divine__ [they were trying to assess the boundary of this principle, or of this method - how far can fiction go?].
	
7. "Réparer le temps en droit (Romain et Medieval)

	- thomas discusses time and continuity.
	
8. "L'extrême et l'ordinaire: Remarques sur le cas médiéval de la communauté disparue"

	- the chapter discusses - again - the relationship between a __juridical entity__ and the people who compose it; the case is interesting because, throughout time, it slowly lost all circumstance [it became pure narrative - like a parable or a fable].
	
9. "Confessus pro judicato - L'aveu civil et l'aveu pénal à Rome"

	- about conscience and confession.
	
10. "La verité, le temps, le juge et l'historien"

	- thomas defends the value of the history of law.
