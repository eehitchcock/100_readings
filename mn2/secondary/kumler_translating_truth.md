#Aiden Kumler: Translating Truth

##Introduction

13. kum;er reminds us of the two __perspectives__ on images in the middle ages - they were either __dangerous distractions__ from the __logos__ and towards the __idols__ [the platonic perspective]; or, they could be useful aids to begin a spiritual journey of approach to __transcendent ideas__; in works of thinkers like gregory the great or saint victor, images were theorized as either __supplement__ or __danger__; their power was __mimesis__ of __tangible reality__; but tangible reality is limited [therefore, as will become apparent in later sections of the book, the work of religious imagery was both to display the terrestrial side of spirituality - e.g. liturgy - and its boundaries - e.g. theophany].

	- the crucial moment, for kumler, was the __transition__ from the __xii__ to the __xiii__ s. [we would tempted to associate this with the raise of gothic art, but that happened earlier in the xii s.], and the __fourth lateran council__ of __1215__ in particular; this year marked a profound "__epistemological optimism__" [faith in the human capacity to know and to be educated], but also a regulation of __liturgical practices__ - __communion__ and __confession__; 1215 also allowed the __preaching and teaching of the scripture__ in the __european vernaculars__, a process that required a __systematic translation__ of __texts__ and __practices__; this prompted the proliferation of the __pastoralia__, manuals for priests - and laypeople [kumler's thesis being that, precisely with the crisis of the clergy in the xii s. and the reformative impulse of 1215, both the laity and the clergy were willing to receive a renewed christian education].

	- pastoralia were often illuminated [as intellectual aids, or - allegedly - to compensate for a lower level of literacy] - this was a __new process of translation__.

	- a different __historical change__ was caused by the __introduction of the creed__ [as a mandatory part of liturgy; it was probably regulated - not introduced - in the council] - a __verbal formula__ that required a radical and deliberate surrender [acceptance] to the unknown - it included not only the __tangible__ aspects of __incarnation__, but also its __transcendent mysteries__; faith was the __surrender__ to __verbally articulated__, yet __unintelligible__ truths [consider dante's prayer to the virgin, _entirely based on impossibilia_]; faith had to __do without reason and the senses__ [think about the importance of christine's __allegorical rendering__ of the creed in othea, then; _the creed is not represented directly, but obliquely, through analogy - not mimesis_].

	- a quotation that deserves a full transcription "for many late medieval elites [...] the english channel served as highway rather than barrier"; kumler goes on to explain that one of the main differences [between normandy/france/continent and england] was __linguistic__ - france had embraced __vernacular__ as a __langue savante__ between xiii and xiv, while england was still "__complexly trilingual__"; french (anglo-norman) was widely used as an __elite language__, whereas __middle english__ was developing slowly, in manuscripts that were not yet illuminated.

	- kumler considers diverse books in her study, from book of hours and psalters to compendia designed specifically for their recipients; [how] did they produce religious truth [through the interaction between image and text]?

##Chapter one

32. the first image interpreted by kumler is that of the __holy church__ holding a __book__ that stands for truth; and that replaced the __host__ in the gesture of elevation (book - truth - host; body and bread) - vienna 2554; according to the author, this is an exemplary illuminated pastoralia - in venacular.

	- for kumler, between the xii and xiii s. there was a clear need for a __widespread clerical training__ and education, culminating in 1215 [the quotation used by kumler is, again, __dietary__ - from r. de courson, about "__toothless__" clergy _in 1207; courson attributes it to gregory_]; for innocent iii and the council, an education of the lay people could compensate for a corrupt clergy.

	- in pastoralia we find the __canon__ of __perficienda__ (things to do) and __credenda__ (things to believe; _these two sides are often embodied in a single illumination - representing both the behavior that is recommended during liturgical occasions, and its deeper meaning_).

	- texts like the __bible moralisée__ envisioned [presupposed and informed] an enlightened laity, cooperating with the clergy within a single __textual community__ [and social community] for a better society [_the society is the church;_ all _of this is expressed_ in the __images__).

43. the systematization of liturgy and belief imposed on the laypeople in 1215 (__omnis utriusque sexus__ - both men and women had to confess and receive communion) was another way to share the responsibility of an __educated church__ [the bible moralisée is absolutely a text to examine again]; the lay elite appropriated it.

##Chapter two

68. now kumler analyzes ways in which illuminated pastoralia instructed lay people on how to __confess__ - their _modus confitendi_; the first attempt in this direction was made by the __libri paenitentiales__ of vi s. ireland [briefly considered here as well]; here we find the idea of __penance__ being __threefold__ - split into __repentance__ (contrition), __confession__, and __satisfaction__.

	- the crucial role of contrition [a performance of repentance, an affective disposition and outer display, concretized in a series of meaningful gestures] was expounded by __abelard__ - for him, this was the moment when an __ethically neutral act__ became __sin__ [again, an act of translation, accomplished through a performance]; similarly, the priest became both a __doctor__ and a __judge__ [a social role; another interpretation - or deeper - allegorical - connotation].

	- this was another instance of __shared responsibility__ between __clergy__ and __laypeople__.

	- the __performance of penitence__ was __narrative__ [narrative self-disclosure, with a required expansion of every circumstantial detail; _think about the relationship between sacrament, narrative, and nudity in sggk, for instance_] and __dialogic__ [following the __master-pupil__ dialectic found in __boethius__]; the first pedagogical text considered by kumler in this sequence is the __speculum virginum__, an __illuminated pedagogical dialogue__ that relies heavily on __images__ [the tree especially; _these images accompany the text - and its affective and intellectual pedagogy - to provide further educational aids_]; this __arboreal metaphor__, together with the specular one, became a recurrent depiction of __vice__ and __virtue__ [in subsequent similar treatises as well; it was a powerful and resounding analogy].

101. now kumler analyzes __illuminations__ accompanying exposition of the __creed__; then the illuminations which depicted the sacrament as a __military resistance__, ideally glossing job's citation on _vita militia_; finally, she considers the way that a xiv s. compendium materializes __typology__ through the structure of its __recto/verso__ [a different way to spatialize allegory and typology - similar to the architectural representation of old and new testament in siena's cathedral].

	- all the examples educate the __lay people__.

##Chapter three

145. this chapter addresses the __epistemological anxiety__ surrounding the eucharist - both a __manifestation__ and a __concealment__ of truth [the epiphany of a mystery]; it was, for kumler, regulated between the xiii and the xiv s., as these texts show.

	- kum;er now focuses on a __hiatus__ in religious practices; in __1208__ pope innocent iii forbade the celebration of the mass in england; during this period, the performance of the mass was redesigned, adding details like the __elevation__ of the host, featured in the __illuminations__ [kumler's work focuses on the __visible__ side of __liturgy__; _but not on misleading details - its focus is always behavior and meaning; here, for instance, the illuminations carefully depict both the attitude and physical position of the worshippers, and the theophany of christ beyond the host - they do not indulge in the depiction of the host itself - because that signifier is irrelevant - the two important elements are the christians gathered in the church, and the transcendent event that they signify or evoke_; e.g. __morgan ms g. 53__, _a psalter where the illuminated initials represent sacraments accompanied by theophanic episodes_].

159. the illuminations not only prescribed a __behavior__ - they instructed about its __meaning__.

##Chapter four

206. here kumler explores the topic of the "__claustral ideal__," a __textual making__ of a __sacred architectural space__; the ms that she analyzes is "somme le roi - sainte abbaïe," a 1294 old french treatise based on the equivalence between __book and physical church__ (bl add. ms 28162; _this analogy is only visible in the first few pages_); on the space of the page, partitioned in __architectural sectors__, vices and virtues are juxtaposed; according to kumler, this is an echo of notre-dame de paris - in both cases, __virtue is personified__ (divine and given), while __vice is exemplified__ (human and accidental, circumstantial).

	- the project of the book is an extended, precise __architectural metaphor__.

237. the second section of this chapter discusses theophany - christ's presence in liturgical practices; the conclusion reminds the reader that this extended metaphor [the book as an architectural space - cloister, house, temple] represents the __soul__ [as temple, house, cloister] too.

##Conclusion

241. kumler reiterates that the processes of __translation__ described by her were also __transformative__ [adaptation is transformation; it is the _making_ of new religious truths].
