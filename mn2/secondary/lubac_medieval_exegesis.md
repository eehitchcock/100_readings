|Language arts; Figurative meaning; Scripture; Aristotelianism|For Henri de Lubac spiritual exegesis was used to write the New Testament; _history_ belonged to the New Testament, _allegory_, _tropology_, and _anagogy_ all belong to the New Testament; the system was challenged with the _disputationes_ of the s. xiii; the order of the senses had wide implications.|

##Preface and introduction

- the work could be considered an __encyclopedia of patristic and medieval exegesis__ of the scripture; it was written [begun] in the __1940s__, while france was occupied by the germans; among its premises, that for which __medieval exegesis__ _was_ __theology__; it was published between __1959__ and __1963__.

	- lubac had fought in _ww1_; he was a jesuit priest and teacher.

	- his thesis is that "__spiritual exegesis__" or allegory is not a borrowing from the greeks, but a __distinctly christian__ approach to the old testament, originally found in paul's epistles.

- __exegesis__ is shaped on the __relationship__ between __old and new testament__; "_the spiritual sense of the old testament is the new testament_." lubac is apparently responding to a tendency in his day - the tendency to consider allegories as a __falsifying tool__, inherited from greek criticism, alien to christianity; he is also trying to confute a prejudice against the middle ages [_he is a medieval writer, participating in the conversations of the time_]; lubac rejects teleological readings, he is constructing a "__sequential history__," though [that is, a history of medieval exegesis that has its culmination in the middle ages, and does not seek the hints of modernity; his history is sequential, although not simplistic - it does incorporate different strands that, altough simultaneous, do not advance in the same direction].

14. the introduction begins with a __mnemonic__ distich worth transcribing - "_the letter teaches events, allegory what you should believe | morality teaches what you should do, anagogy what mark you should aim for." its author is augistine of dacia, died in 1282.

	- the verses were rewritten many times by subsequent authors [this process of transcription is far from neutral]; __theories of allegory__ were often expressed __allegorically__ (rivers flowing and clear water); the conclusion, however, is that __history__ is related to the __old testament__, while __allegory, tropology, and anagogy__ _all_ concern the __new testament__.

	- the number __four__ is a crucial element of the system; at times the four corners were occupied by four roman rhetoricians; at times four evangelists; at times, four latin patres - jerome, augustine, ambrose and gregory; they were identified with the evangelists (and their tetramporphic shapes).

	- the belief in the fourfold sense of the scripture was rejected by luther - he found it __impious__; his understanding is shared by many protestants; but this interpretation remained a __cardinal element__ of __catholic identity__; in the medieval period it was used to __structure libraries and pedagogical methods__; _influential_ [simply consider the work of systematization accomplished by hugh of saint victor].

##Chapter one

40. __interpretation__ possessed a certain degree of [interpretive] __freedom__, especially as one departed from the literal understanding of __history__.

	- hugh of saint victor organized education after the model of fourfold interpretation.

	- the freedom of interpretation (allegorical interpretation) had to be regulated by __discipline__ - a __rule__ (like the monastic one); but discipline was not purely intellectual - it was related to __tropology__.

	- according to hugh of s. victor, and to the tradition which he systematized - "all of divine revelaton is contained in the __scripture__; all of __theological science__ is encompassed in this interpretation; the history of this interpretation, the tradition that one could never ignore, was the church - the __institution of interpretation__; the difficulties of interpretation in fact prompted __mistakes__ (heresies), and required the aid of an __institution__.

	- the crucial idea is that the scripture contained __all__; this explained, then, the extension of their readings to the classical world (i. e., virgil).

74. the interpretation of scripture was therefore the __principle__ and __structuring__ idea of __all knowledge__; __every discipline__ submitted to medieval exegesis, and medieval exegesis was the source of all discipline (__scripture__ contained everything).

	- this viewpoint was first challenged in the renaissance of s. xii; with the raise of scholasticism, the idea of __lectio__ (meditation and prayer) began to incorporate that of __disputatio__ (intellectual debate); now reading and interpretation could prompt __disputationes__.

	- in the xi s., intellectuals began looking for _quaestiones_ __outside__ the realm of __scriptural interpretation__; with the xii s., quaestiones multiplied; soon [some] theologians began reacting harshly to them, because they were pushing readers away from the scriptures.

	- the result of this ongoing debate on the role of quaestiones was the raise of __two sides__ - the "__allegorical interpreters__" and the "__dialectical interpreters__" (dialectic being the __method of quaestiones__); the form of the disputationes now had a strong __ideological value__; in the xiii s., __scholastic__ - and its explosive methods - won; soon it started to incorporate the methods and the teachings of __aristotle__.

##Chapter two

105. scripture is __inexhaustible__; this created debates around the __number of senses__ to be found [three or four - or more], and their __hierarchy__ [does tropology follow allegory?]; at times __anagogy__ would be the leading sense; at times, __tropology__ [_leading sense_ probably meant _ultimate objective_ - the last element of the progression: is it an ehtical prescription, or an intellectual discovery?].

115. the differences in order were significant [__extremely significant__]; the most widespread one had allegory _before_ tropology (tropology depicted as allegory - __moral__ as __interpretation__); its origin is the iii s. [an uninterrupted history from the beginnings of christianity to the early middle ages; this __order__ may be a good element to trace in previous readings - in christine, for instance, the _moral gloss_ __precedes__ the _allegorie_].

##Chapter three

159. the __two lists__ (history - allegory - tropology and history - morality - allegory) had their origin in __two traditions__ started by the latin patres - gregory on one side, cassian on the other; the origin of both is __origen__.

	- the reason of the order's importance becomes clear when we realize that, if morality comes straight out of history, it will be the result of __purely human speculation__ [it is an almost paradoxical conclusion; literal interpretations are the most arbitrary; but you should also consider the wider dangers of extrapolating a code of behavior from the literal understanding of a sacred text - a conflict that still resonates to this day].

	- origen died around 253, but he was still read in 410, when rome fell against visigoth forces [this is lubac's way of making us realize the dramatic changes of the time - here not only political and social, but also cultural and linguistic]; he remained highly influential [across time].

##Chapter four

198. in origen we found both methods - morality drawn from allegory or from history (almost autonomous); his works were translated into __latin__ during the v s. (rome had fallen); in the xi s. he is read and interpreted extensively (earlier, in the carolingian ix s. as well); to him we owe, for instance, the __traditionaL allegorical interpretation__ of the __song of songs__ [_this fact deserves much attention; the song of songs - the metaphor of marriage - is the first text interpreted allegorically_; lubac keeps paralleling the two renaissances - the ix and the xii ss.]; isidore [560 - 636] was one of its keenest readers.

	- his reception was uninterrupted, although __controversial__ [he was often blamed of having castrated himself; _the circumstance is worth addressing here - because we would have a literal understanding of an evangelical injunction in action - origen would have been, in fact, reading jesus' words in matthew 19:12 as a recommendation to become an eunuch for salvation_].

224. many writers maintained a __timid__ approach to origen; but he remained read and __implicitly__ cited [some glosses and commentaries are clearly indebted to his works, although they do not explicitly mention him].

##Chapter five

241. the scripture has two meanings - __literal__ and __spiritual__; these two meanings __are__ the scripture - they are the old and the new testament.

	- the relationship between the two, often __typological__, was modeled after the writings of the __prophets__ [who interpreted and rewrote previous texts in a similar way]; but the __new testament__ was considered the __definitive typological text__ - the "eternal instant" [the eternity that all time is referring to, towards which all time tends, which all time means]; the __life of christ__ is the source of all meaning, present, future, and past; he is __exegesis__ and __exegete__ of all.

267. lubac names this relationship __harmony__ [using the same musical metaphor occasionally deployed by hugh of saint victor, about the concordance of every meaning]; it is one of the __leading ideas of christianity__.
