##Introduction

- alfonso de palencia lived between 1424 and 1492; the _batalla campal_ was originally written in __latin__; he was a clerk and a historiographer; his writings were often overtly political; he was also a translator.

	- the original latin text is lost; we assume that it was written before 1456; its genre is the __animal fable__, but its description of the battle is very accurate; it may in fact stand for a military handbook [_or not; in fact, the description of the battle is accurate in that it depicts its brutal violence with realism and energy - but no strategical concepts; in fact, it seems the denial of strategy_]; the actual meaning of the allegory is __debated__ [although it certainly had to do with the civil war caused by the conflict between henry iv and the aristocracy; that of wolves and dogs was a metaphor often used to satirize or lament the circumstance - the "dogs" who were supposed to protect the "sheep" were now turning against them, like "wolves"].
	
##Commentary

0. the prologue first addresses the problem of the __translation__, a project attempted to let as many noblemen [understandably, given the political context in which the work was allegedly written] as possible enjoy the book (although the vernacular is rarely as good as the latin, _according to alfonso_).

	- the model is the _batracomiomaquía de pseudo-homero_; palencia explains that he wishes to practice the art on a smaller project before beginning his major work of __spanish historiography__ [he wanted to become the kingdom's chronicler; the work was supposed to appeal to the monarch]; the work is immediately presented as a locked allegory (a _roman à clef_), whose key is held by the recipient of the work (he's been breastfeed by philosophy herself, _palencia explains_); then palencia explains the causes of the conflict (_which are purely geographical - circumstantial_).
	
	- the opening of the story is a geographical setting: a mountain in andalucía, where a river protects the wild beasts with its vegetation [here we have, apparently, a combination of __historical circumstance__ - _the toponyms_ - and __allegorical meaning__ - _the animals, the unspecified spatial details_].
	
1. we meet the __wolf leader__, antartón, his wife and his family; one of his hunters, harpaleo, leaves the territory to catch a hearty meal for the pack; we follow harpaleo and his companion, pancerion, as they reach the pastures from which they wish to steal the sheep; with a stratagem, harpaleo distracts the dogs, and they ambush the defenders of the flock (like _parliament of fowls_, the description moves back and forth in anthropomorphization and zoomorphization; _from human language to animal gesture_); the dogs even bark (an __onomatopoeia__ in their direct speech "ham-ham!"; _the wolves are generally more humanized than the dogs_).

	- the two wolves discuss the value of ominous __signifiers__ - the flight of a crow as they walked past it [in chaucer this would be a meditation on _interpretation tout court_; a question for the reader - are these simply animals (like the crow flying), or more than that (signs that represent and forewarn reality)?]; the handbook is therefore a __catalogue of conversations__ concerning issues encountered by warriors [besides being an animal fable; it is a model of rhetoric and - possibly - a meditation on the violence that it conceals].
	
	- the first struggle is a __violent defeat__ (the physical details of the two animals are mentioned as they are torn apart by violence; _violence is therefore equal to zoomorphization, as the denial of rational speech and military strategy; here it is harpaleo, the fighter who rejected the wise wolf's strategic advice, who suffers the most; pancerion, sneaking past the dogs, gets what he wants - but isn't his hunger still very much nonhuman?_); harpaleo, who arrogantly believed that he could win without efforts, has to retreat; in the meanwhile, the wise old wolf, pancarion, gets the fat sheep, and he is praised by the leader and the whole pack.
	
15. the leader sends out two scouts to look for harpaleo's body; they find him, almost dead and covered in blood; the king, the women and the warriors all seek __revenge__ - they __discuss the importance__ of honor and revenge.

	- the scene is that of a council, with the respectable wolves of the pack advising the king with __rhetoric and reason__, according to their age, status, and psychology (or personality; they are stylistically remarkable pieces); the oldest speaker tells a story of wolves and dogs which inverts the customary perspective on their roles [__rhetoric__, one of the main elements of the story, has the potential to anthropomorphize the wolves; they are no longer wild beasts - they now are as innocent as the dogs, and separated only by the landscape], and it contends the need for a __total war__ (_a genocide_; it is the alternative to the civil war being permanently fought between the two sides) on grounds that seem almost racist (dogs and wolves are treated like the two races of the same species - they have common genetic ancestors; _better, they both used to be dogs, and they have been separated by custom and geography; the racial implications may still be there, but the narrative emphasizes the original continuity between the two, not the phenotypical differences_); a fox - calidina - is sought as the ally of wolves (she "bends her knees" in front of the king - another anthropomorphic gesture which, in fact, prompts the reader to conflate the two; _calidina is perhaps the most anthropomorphic among these animals, although she is not explicitly rhetorically articulate_), and as their __herald__ [she is therefore a sort of intermediary as well]; she seeks a mastiff dog, and announces the upcoming field battle (the dog is big and dumb; _his outer appearance supposedly mirrors - or stands for - his inner qualities_).
	
25. the leader of the dogs - halipa - is described in detail [another zoomorphizing move; these are meaningful choices, as if one might understand the ethical structure of the book by contemplating the characters' proximity to one side or the other]; it is the description of a warrior __and__ a dog; he receives the message from the mastiff, who is mocked for his stupidity and lack of breadth (the book often has __comedic elements__; these may constitute the satirical aspect of the allegory, given that these creatures may stand for something or someone else); the dog leader seems arrogant; they all decide to follow the advice of a belligerent dog - who parallels the racist old wolf from the pack.

	- but the political setting is __more complex__; on the one hand, the fox thinks about the profits that this war will bring her [she is humanly smart], regardless of its outcome; on the other, the dogs are now split into two sides - the mastiffs will fight, the others will not [and this ulterior division starts to create problems in our understanding of the piece; as if the author was evoking a civil war within the civil war].
	
	- the leader of the mastiffs keeps acting with arrogance [despite the problematic and potentially indecipherable allegory, the book certainly takes a pedagogical or moralizing stance against ubris], and he summons his warriors to war - they are all boasting with ubris; in the meanwhile, wolves and dogs arrive from all europe, increasing the size of both armies, and creating a food shortage (but the dogs are fed by the shepherds; _the food is another problematic signifier; in war this may stand for actual food, but in a broader political allegory it could be any sort of source, including money; notice that the introduction of national boundaries is another interpretive obstacle to the establishment of precise correspondences between creatures and political or ethnic entities_); for hunger, some italian wolves attach the spanish dogs before the beginning of the war [food is undoubtedly central in the allegory].
	
35. three days before the war, both wolves and dogs lose some warriors in a brief fight; the outcome [of the whole conflict] will not be predictable [and, we may assume, war never is - is this another lesson by the historiographer alfonso de palencia - war is unpredictable chaos?].

	- on the day of the battle, the armies are arranged according to the nationalities of each group [this is the only instance where there seems to be some sort of strategic inspiration guiding the beasts; but it is short lived, and in retrospect almost a mockery].
	
	- the battle is also __rhetorical__ [and, again, antrhopomorphic speeches contrast the zoomorphic violence that ensues]; the two leaders stir their warriors with speeches reported by palencia.
	
	- the actual battle is a sequence of __cruel, bloody acts__ - a list of deaths, from the weakest to the strongest fighters; even the two leaders are brutally biting each other.
	
	- with the beginning of dawn, the battle is suspended - both sides are heavily injured and scared [each for its own reasons; the fire lit by shepherds for the wolves, the wild creatures attacking for the dogs - hostility is environmental, and only heightened by the upcoming night time]; to compensate his troops, the leader of the dogs sends some warriors to fetch some sheep; these wolves steal them from an old, sleeping dog - an indecorous deed, unworthy of the fighters.
	
	- the foreign warriors are thanked and celebrated on both sides, although no war was fought (the conclusion emphasizes this frustration through a series of anaphoric "no").
	
	- the epilogue reiterates the presence of an __allegorical meaning__; warns the recipient [like the crow on the path].
