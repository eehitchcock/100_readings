- _Introduction_.

	- montoya starts by describing the life and the political accomplishments of alfonso x, especially relevant in science and arts; it should be noted that, while "castellano derecho" is the language of his court, his policies, and his nonfictional, serious works, for poetry he employs the "__gallego-portugues__"; his name is linked to both __secular__ and __religious__ works, creating a sense of __ambiguity__ and even __contradiction__ [_this is relevant to his production as a whole, not to the cantigas themselves_].

	- the religious subject was probably also chosen in a reaction to the __persecution__ of the __albigesian crusade__.

	- the _cantigas_ (427) constitute a distinct __authorial project__, and one often regarded as one of the masterpieces of the genre (the collection of poems, or "cancionero"); they all belong to the same genre of the __laus__ (praise; _inaccurate; a sequence of miracles leads to a single song of praise_).

	- the cancionero is a __combination__ of __poetry, song, image__; it survives in __four ms__, only one of which contains all of the 427 cantigas; two of these are __intensely decorated__, with full cycles of __images__; as a general principle, the structure of the book has __nine miracles__ and a __tenth cantiga__ that works as a __song of praise__ (but it is not a __consistent__ structure); in the __collection__ we find __every verse form known in spain at the time__ (except for the sonnet; _this is true for the cantigas themselves_); it is __almost contemporary__ with berceo's milagros, they can also be regarded as __short stories__, showing the __daily life of xiii s. spain__; it is an __encyclopedic project__ (with a __distinguishable unifying project__, the devotion to mary).

	- the richest illuminated ms. of the _cantigas_ is the __codice rico__ (1250-1300); noticeably, at times the event depicted in the miniatures __do not match the text__.

	- the poems were collected and compiled between __1257__ and __1280__; the illuminated ms. of codice rico was probably prepared around the same time.

	- the structure of the book follows several principles; __every ten miracles we find a praise__, and every __hundred cantigas__ we find __substantial moments of devotion__; each cantiga contains a __refrain__ - defined as the "rason" - which __illuminated the meaning__ - often the teaching - of the __cantiga__ - what we have to __learn__ from the miracle or the praise; the main character of the miracles is usually a person __missing something__, often a __sinner__ (wasting or lacking); the _cantigas_ were written to be __sung__ on a __melody__; the three elements of a cantiga, therefore, where __razon__, __miragre__, __son__; we should add __image__ to this system.

	- in the introduction the author presents his project - to be a __trobador__ for mary and her miracles; it is a combination of __poetical skill__ and will, and her grace, imbued onto him.

	- the cantigas as a system seem to embody __typology__ in a tight temporal __conflation__; the sequence starts with __mary as the mother of christ__, then moves to her apparition to saint alfonso in toledo; the very structure of the cantiga, with the __present refrain__ (always __true__, the __constant knowledge__ of __eternity__) in the __past narrative__ of the __miracle__ - temporally bound - suggests these __multiple temporalities interacting__; the same might be said for the __architectural syntax of the miniatures__, juxtaposing __chronologically distinct__ episodes within the same space.

	- the miracle of cantiga 4, an antisemitic story that has some analogies with the prioress' tale, is depicted through an exemplary __management of spaces__.

	- the idea of __unity in difference__ is exemplified by the __form__ adopted by the work as well, with the __different metres__ adapting to the __same alternation__ of __refrain and stanza__.

	- the same __miracle of the prioress' tale__ is actually found in cantiga 6; cantiga 9 again thematizes the problem of __images__ and their power (the project of the cantigas seems to endorse and promote the worshipping of images - their very persistance through time).

	- like in gonzalo, the miracle is a __sudden emergence of meaning__; but here it is __typology__, not __allegory__.
