#Hugo of St. Victor - Didascalicon: De Studio Legendi

##Introduction

- composed at Paris in the late 1120s; to provide "intellectual and practical orientation for students of varying ages and levels" who came to the open school of st. victor.

- a handbook and a __theory of education__; the first book, for instance, proves why there are only __four arts__ in the __quadrivium__ [the order in which these contents are delivered is crucial; indeed, hugh is careful to present the theoretical foundations __before__ his method of interpretation, and way __before__ the techniques used for allegorical reading; allegory - the most delicate and powerful tool - has to be assimilated at the end, after the establishment of a solid intellectual system]; it is a combination of __christian philosophy__ and __neoplatonism__ [boethius especially].

##Comment

0. [preface] it is a book about __reading__; reading, with "__meditation__," is one of the two ways in which men attain knowledge [hugh's handbook is a constant warning against the dangers of unrestrained interpretation; it is also a constant attempt to belittle its importance, to introduce methods and goals that are as important, or more important]. the book teaches __what to read__ [__crucial__, the establishment of a canon] and __how to read__. it is divided in two parts: reading the __arts__ [theoretical foundations, the system of disciplines] and reading the __scriptures__. hugh __immediately__ endows the attainment of knowledge with an __ethical valence__ - will [wish] to be better [to improve ethically].

1. __wisdom__ characterizes the __human__ [conscious of its superiority to the rest of nature; _wisdom is also the very conscience of its superiority_]; the soul is __impressed__ by the reality which it encounters [this impression is a sort of distraction; when _impressed_, the soul begins to resemble other objects, and no longer itself]; wisdom [on the other hand] is the knowledge of the soul itself - the soul as what it is [expoliated from its impressions].

	- the work is also a __juxtaposition__ of diverse quotations - here, for instance, __boethius__ [it is a work of reading, about reading; it is an example of the very method which it presents; a model for correct reading] - passages quoted __in their entirety__ [respectful approach to the sources and their authority], one after the other - __reading__ and the __practice of reading__.

	- now we see the three parts of the soul - __vegetativa, sensitiva, rationale__ [vegetabilis, sensibilis, rationalis]; __philosophy__ is the study of __all human activities__; therefore, all __human activities__ are governed by __one single principle__ - __wisdom__; soul is one and three [trinity is multiplicity from unity]; everything is reduced to __one idea__ - __wisdom__ [boethian knowledge here; _notice how this eventually sets the premises for the careful presentation of allegory and interpretation, in the final section; everything has to be connected, or reduced, to the single divine principle; allegory does the same; it is not a translation of new ideas into a foreign language - it is a translation of familiar ideas, orthodox ideas, into a familiar language_].
	
	- __a different dichotomy__: man is __good__ [incomplete] and __evil__ [to be removed, _the flaw, lack or fault that determines man's incompleteness_]; ethical and __intellectual__ [dichotomy]; he participates of __two temporalities__ and __two natures__ - __necessity__ [immanence, finiteness, time] and __divinity__ [transcendence, infiniteness, eternity]; __virtue__ and __knowledge__ are two ways to __improve__ [increment, augment, serve; like in the following instance, hugh does not impose explicit hierarchies; intellectual pursuits do not seem to be more praiseworthy than ethical ones; __activa__ and __contemplativa__ coexist here] the divine side; knowledge can be a __human action__ [__scientia__] or a __divine__ action [__intelligentia__; _notice how knowledge is an action; how its purpose can be practical; and how this seems to echo the distinction between virtue and knowledge_].

	- the book ends by describing the __four types__ of knowledge [corresponding to every aspect of human activity] - __theoretical, practical, mechanical, logical__ (truth, ethics, work, language); __use__ preceded the __arts__ [this is a _beautiful section_, where science is described as an __abstraction__ of __human activity__ _(which always preceded it)_ - of __necessary__, even spontaneous human activity - i.e., measuring a field preceded geometry; _this assumption anticipates hugh's claims about his early education as a child, and about the necessity of history before allegory in the analysis of a text_]; these correspond to __four operations__ in the world, all ordered by the one wisdom [one is always practicing knowledge, then, even when this knowledge is simply applied, or implied, in his or her activities].

2. the four parts of knowledge correspond to four parts of the soul [they depend on __theology__ and __mathematics__, _two analogous abstractions; again the system of correspondences is a universal reduction to god, a translation that is centripetal - not centrifugal_]; hugh spends some time breaking the soul and the body into __numbers__ [another translation], to demonstrate that they can all be retraced back to the number four.

	- the quadrivium [music, arithmetic, geometry, astronomy], is explained according to the __history__ and __etymology__ of each term [after a mathematical explanation, here we have a philological one; notice how hugh is focusing on the scientific side of knowledge - the quadrivium - before moving to the humanistic one - the trivium of grammar, logic, and rhetoric].
 
	- a new distinction is introduced: __physics__, __mathematics__ and __logic__ correspond to __natural__, __intelligiible__ and __intellectible__; these are the __theoretical sciences__; then we have the __practical ones__ [solitary. private, and public, _they correspond to the ethical sciences, such as politics and morals_], and the __mechanical ones__ (fabric, armament, commerce, agriculture, hunting, medicine, and theatrics), which are __not liberal__, and which are then described in their __several parts__ [here the book becomes a sort of __dictionary__; hugh is listing terms; the book is a __linguistic appropriation__ - an __abstraction__, of every sort of __human activity__; _it could work in both senses, however; the preoccupation always seems to be to have matter before idea, physics before metaphysics; hugh is now listing objects, and the objects precede the words that denote them_]; __food__ [the connection to it is crucial here] is listed in detail under the section devoted to __hunting__ [a great digression - __non liberal__, _that is, food is, at least apparently, the human product that is most removed from liberal arts - the most illiberal human preoccupation; and this, for hugh, has to precede any exploration of the humanities_], followed by __medicine__ [and by theatrics, which is, apparently but not explicitly, at the border between mechanical and liberal].

	- the book ends with a __sudden description__ of __grammar__ and __logic__ [two thirds of the trivium]; both depend on __language__ [another artifact, perhaps - another human activity]; hugh then wishes to demonstrate how invention and judgement fit here [his system so far].

3. the book begins by listing the __authors__ who theorized about the arts [this is an __index__ of __suggested readings__, and a tentative __history__ of these disciplines]; then hugh lists the __arts__ which should be mastered by educated men - the trivium and the quadrivium.

	- his list of readings distinguishes between __proper philosophy__ (the arts) and the "appendages of the arts," which include those writings which we would call __literary__ (__poetry__), and which are infinitely distant from the __wisdom__ of proper __philosophy__ [they are __fruitless distractions__; here, again, poetry is almost __mechanical__ - __oral gratification__, like food; _hugh's main purpose remains centripetal; different texts are dangerous because they are distracting_].

	- hugh presents two __cardinal rules__ - property and __synthesis__; the arts should not be mixed, at least initially [grammar should be presented "grammatically"]; they should be presented briefly, with __conciseness__ [one should avoid distractions; _same orthodox principles already seen_].

	- hugh now describes how one should __read__ in detail; it is a __practical__ guide, detailing __memory__, order, and method.

	- the __method__ is analysis, and analysis proceeds from __concrete__ to __abstract__ [keep this notion in mind; here, again, we find an anticipation of his preoccupation with history]; reading should culminate in __meditation__ [which is not only an activity, but also the highest degree of abstract thought], which should - again - be __methodical__; memory is, as well, based on the __distillation__ of knowledge to its first essence; the simple __root__ is what ought to be remembered [avoiding distractions; hugh's project is a combination of concreteness and simplicity].

	- hugh describes the __ethical stance__ of a good reader as well - his __humility__; his __intellectual honesty__, described as a __behavior__; the virtues of a scholar in a foreign land [the final sentence of this book is intensely poetical, and personal; it is an __intimate section__; _for hugh, the perfect scholar has no home country, and he should feel that "the entire world is as a foreign land"_].

4. the book starts by pointing out the difficulty in determining which books should be deemed __sacred__; then he lists them [the books of the scripture], then their aurhors; he explains the meanings of their names, and their history [_a slow approach to reading; one starts by learning a few certain facts about the texts_]. this serves as an __introduction__ to the themes and the utility of each book; much of this section is constituted by __quotations__ [mostly from isidore's etymologiae].

	- the section of the __gospels__ describes their philological context, and is followed by one on the synods. finally, a list of apocryphal books [_this advances the strongly orthodox project of the book_], and a list of etymologies "pertaining to reading" [they all deal with the material side of the activity; the instruments of the intellectual profession].

5. now hugh describes how to __intepret__ the scriptures [which] have three ways of conveying meaning - __history__, __allegory__, __tropology__; these do not always operate all at the same time; but they always __concord__ and __resound__ with each other, creating a sort of __harmony of meaning__ [the __musical__ parallel _with the various parts - cords, neck, body - of a guitar_ is especially striking].

	- hugh explains that the scripture uses not only __words__, but __things__ as signifiers - the devil is a __lion__ means that an actual __lion__ [the __thing__ lion] has to become the __signifier__ for the devil [this is another plea for historical readings; hugh is asking us to consider the literal sense above all, and before everything else; he is also asking us never to forget its presence; we have to read the scriptures, and allegories, as if they were written using an alphabet of concrete referents, of actual things; for hugh, it is impossible to disregard the physically tangible signifiers of allegory - the vehicles - which are always real].

	- the first device explored __extensively__ in all its implications is __synecdoche__ [_a powerful instrument; and perhaps the most conservative of devices - it does not ask us to alter the meaning of a signifier, only to change its scope; a thing remains true and literal, only smaller or bigger; it also leads to the familiar generalizations of religion, such as typology - abraham and isaac stand for every father and every son_]; the greater justification for synecdoche is the __ambivalence__ of god's temporality - between __eternity__ and __finiteness__ [for god human dimensions have no meaning; for god time is irrelevant, as is any sort of human boundary or proportion].

	- hugh's perspective often shifts to the __material conditions__ and __practices__ of __scholarly activity__; here he tries to explain why some students __learn faster__ than others [his justifications all have to do with material circumstances; and these always precede the intellectual side of the problem].

	- the purpose of reading is twofold - it improves our __moral sense__ (__tropology, imitation__), and it increases our __knowledge__(__allegory and history__); for hugh they are __equally important__ [crucial point]; morals are taught by __example__ and __instruction__ - and one should not spend his entire life trying to decypher obscure texts, but instead __model__ his behavior after the __explicit and literal__ lives of the saints [pedestrian imitation off what is obviously stated is valuable; _again, the emphasis is on the material, immanent side_].

	- hugh warns about reading too much or too intensely; reading should be a __peaceful__, satisfactory activity - not a striving for an unachievable infinity; those who are beginning their education, howevery, should strive for diligence [they should have a strong thirst for more knowledge, which is highly necessary to them]; studying is only the first step towards perfect knowledge; it is followed by __meditation__, __prayer__, __performance__, and __contemplation__ - the last stage, that which allows one to achieve __perfect knowledge__ [it seems a combination of __activa__ and __contemplativa__, __intellectual__ and __religious__ pursuit, __knowing__ and __unknowing__ _as in the "cloud"_]; one can at times __recede__ from one stage to the previous.

	- knowledge, finally, can be __sought__ for different reasons - material richness, entertainment, or __spiritual improvement__; only the latter is __ethically acceptable__.

6. the final book concerns the __research__ for __knowledge__ in books of the __scripture__; it starts by listing again the components of __order__ and __method__ [rules and structure, to avoid distractions and heterodoxy]; __order__ is initially defined as that leading from __history__ [to] __allegory__ and __tropology__ [that is, with history first]; hugh first praises and recommends a thorough and exacting study of __history__ - it should be __systematic__ and __gradual__, like the attentive education of a __child__ [which hugh describes in detail, remembering his own childish methods to exercise and practice his memory _and asking us to identify with that child; when faced with the books of the scripture, we all are children who need to start from the basic notions, he seems to imply_]; the section ends with a __summary__ of __old and new testament__ - this brief paraphrasis is used as a means to memorize and understand literal meanings [one should be able to summarize and remember as he does].

	- the section on __allegory__ starts by comparing this device with food - "solid stuff" that needs to be "chewed" before it can be "swallowed."

	- the __metaphor__ of the "mason" laying down the foundations of a house before building it is one of hugh's favorites; he uses it to explain the __science of interpretation__ - all rocks must fit together; the idea is that __allegorical reading__ is the __construction__ of a building whose __bases__ correspond to mysteries of our faith - trinity, free will, sin, and so on; the building blocks are passages [and other structural elements] from the scriptures; thus, we realize that __allegorical reading__ is an __active__ endeavor - a process of __production__ of knowledge, not __reception__ [careful, though - it is the production of a knowledge _which we already know_; the creative side of this analogy is precisely aimed at reminding us that we cannot build anything outside of the bases that have already been decided for us; we can build one or two identical buildings, regardless of the building blocks which we use]; the mason metaphor confirms this.

	- __chronological order__ is irrelevant for allegory; in fact, in its study the new testament - and its revelations - should be studied before the old one.

	- the __necessity__ for allegorical - spiritual - intepretation is at times evident; the __understandability__ of a text may be __limited__ either in __letter__ (linguistic obscurity, word level), sense (interpretive obscurity - coherence level _from phrase to phrase_), or __deeper meaning__ (interpretive obscurity, textual level - _as a whole_).

	- the __method__ of interpretation is __analysis__ - breaking a text into its smaller units; the book ends here [somehow unsatisfactorily; interpretation being less than it seemed at the beginning], because __meditation__ would require a longer, more exhaustive and focused exposition [and this sense of frustration is what reading should eventually produce; reading is, by itself, insufficient].
