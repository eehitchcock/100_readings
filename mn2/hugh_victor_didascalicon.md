#Hugo of St. Victor - Didascalicon: De Studio Legendi

##Introduction

- composed at Paris in the late 1120s; to provide "intellectual and practical orientation for students of varying ages and levels" who came to the open school of st. victor.

- a handbook and a __theory of education__; the first book, for instance, proves why there are only __four arts__ in the __quadrivium__ [the order in which these contents are delivered is crucial; indeed, hugh is careful to present the theoretical foundations __before__ his method of interpretation, and way __before__ the techniques used for allegorical reading; allegory - the most delicate and powerful tool - has to be assimilated at the end, after the establishment of a solid intellectual system]; it is a combination of __christian philosophy__ and __neoplatonism__ [boethius especially].

##Comment

0. [preface] it is a book about __reading__; reading, with "__meditation__," is one of the two ways in which men attain knowledge [hugh's handbook is a constant warning against the dangers of unrestrained interpretation; it is also a constant attempt to belittle its importance, to introduce methods and goals that are as important, or more important]. the book teaches __what to read__ [__crucial__, the establishment of a canon] and __how to read__. it is divided in two parts: reading the __arts__ [theoretical foundations, the system of disciplines] and reading the __scriptures__. hugh __immediately__ endows the attainment of knowledge with an __ethical valence__ - will [wish] to be better [to improve ethically].

1. __wisdom__ characterizes the __human__ [conscious of its superiority to the rest of nature; _wisdom is also the very conscience of its superiority_]; the soul is __impressed__ by the reality which it encounters [this impression is a sort of distraction; when _impressed_, the soul begins to resemble other objects, and no longer itself]; wisdom [on the other hand] is the knowledge of the soul itself - the soul as what it is [expoliated from its impressions].

	- the work is also a __juxtaposition__ of diverse quotations - here, for instance, __boethius__ [it is a work of reading, about reading; it is an example of the very method which it presents; a model for correct reading] - passages quoted __in their entirety__ [respectful approach to the sources and their authority], one after the other - __reading__ and the __practice of reading__.

	- now we see the three parts of the soul - __vegetativa, sensitiva, rationale__ [__***TO BE SEARCHED***__]; __philosophy__ is the study of __all human activities__; therefore, all __human activities__ are governed by __one single principle__ - __wisdom__; soul is one and three [trinity is multiplicity from unity]; everything is reduced to __one idea__ - __wisdom__ [boethian knowledge here; _notice how this eventually sets the premises for the careful presentation of allegory and interpretation, in the final section; everything has to be connected, or reduced, to the single divine principle; allegory does the same; it is not a translation of new ideas into a foreign language - it is a translation of familiar ideas, orthodox ideas, into a familiar language_].

	- __a different dichotomy__: man is __good__ [incomplete] and __evil__ [to be removed, _the flaw, lack or fault that determines man's incompleteness]; ethical and __intellectual__; he participates of __two temporalities__ and __two natures__ - __necessity__ [immanence, finiteness, time] and __divinity__ [transcendence, infiniteness, eternity]; __virtue__ and __knowledge__ are two ways to __improve__ [increment, augment, serve; like in the following instance, hugh does not impose explicit hierarchies; intellectual pursuits do not seem to be more praiseworthy than ethical ones; __activa__ and __contemplativa__ coexist here] the divine side; knowledge can be a __human action__ [__scientia__] or a __divine__ action [__intelligentia__; _notice how knowledge is an action; how its purpose can be practical; and how this seems to echo the distinction between virtue and knowledge_].

	- the book ends by describing the __four types__ of knowledge [corresponding to every aspect of human activity] - __theoretical, practical, mechanical, logical__ (truth, ethics, work, language); __use__ preceded the __arts__ [this is a _beautiful section_, where science is described as an __abstraction__ of __human activity__ _(which always preceded it)_ - of __necessary__, even spontaneous human activity - i.e., measuring a field preceded geometry; _this assumption anticipates hugh's claims about his early education as a child, and about the necessity of history before allegory in the analysis of a text_]; these correspond to __four operations__ in the world, all ordered by the one wisdom [one is always practicing knowledge, then, even when this knowledge is simply applied, or implied, in his or her activities].
