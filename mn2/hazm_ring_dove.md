#The Ring of the Dove

##Introduction

- the book [that is, the introduction to it] starts by presenting the [historical] background - the book [itself] was written [around __1022__] during the arab domination of the spanish peninsula; when the author - ibn hazm - was born, the kingdom of andalusia had been established for three centuries.

	- ibn hazm's family had converted to christianity; they were a prominent family, and ibn hazm was able to enjoy an "excellent education" (most of his teachers were women); political unrest forced him to leave cordova, and travel around the country, while the kingdom experienced the chaos of a complex dynastic conflict (between umaiyad and hammudid); he changed allegiances often, but his fortune was always short-lived, and religious dissent even prompted his books to be publicly burnt in seville.
	
	- the ring of the dove survives in a __single manuscript__, editorially problematic; it was ibn hazm's __only literary work__ (he wrote primarily on theology and law).
	
	- the work is apparently indebted to the trubadour poetry of the time.
	
	- the editor explains that literature was somehow __foreign__ and __suspect__ to arabic readers; the persians introduced them to "elegant prose" and fiction; the greeks to rhetoric and dialectic; both introduced them to erotic literature, an engagement which at times contrasted mohammed's teachings.
	
	- the book tries to conciliate somber ethical meditation, prompted by ibn hazm's faith, with his __erotic stories__ [they concern the effects of love - and passion, but not explicitly sex, which ibn hazm eventually refuses], accompanied by __poems__ and __theoretical discussions__ (all forming a __coherent whole__; _the project is therefore in itself interesting_); the editor adds that, while its prose is commendable and elegant, its poetry is allegedly mediocre (he was working in 1953).
	
##Commentary

0. the first few words cite and gloss the __koran__; but the premise of the book is familial [better, homely] - a letter from a friend, asking the author to write a book about love; he has - he apologizes for the __limited perspective__ of his experience and knowledge [but it is on the cosmological and theological expansion of this limited perspective that the book is based]; he ends by justifying the choice of maintaining some of the characters unnamed - for their privacy.

	- the "preliminary excursus" presents the plan and the project of the work; thirty chapters - the first ten on the "root-principles of love," the second section on the "accidents of love," and its good or bad attributes; a third section on the misfortunes of love; it is a __coherent project__ [and its explicit aim is consistently maintained as a description - and prescription - of love].
	
	- ibn [hazm] then proceeds to praise love and its diverse qualities - and he contends that it is not __unholy__; in fact, many caliphs and imams, and even saints, have experienced love; ibn even presents his [neoplatonic, the book being a __rewriting of phaedrus__] __theory__ about the nature of love - "a conjunction between scattered parts of souls that have become divided in this physical universe" (__division__ is only a feature of the __mortal world__; the transcendent world works through __union__); the platonic (arguably) perspective has a __concrete demonstration__ - __love does not obey [conform to] any visible, knowable principle__ - it is neither solely motivated by external beauty, nor by a harmony of characters - it resides in the __unspeakable__, unsignified recesses of the soul [here the work has many analogies with chaucer's _parliament_; love is an untranslatable idea - therefore, it prompts both allegory and theory, both narrative anecdote and lyrical insight - indeed, between exterior signifier and interior attempt to decipher it].
	
	- the object of ibn [hazm]'s interest is now the love that arises from "__passion__"; he compares it to __magnetism__ and __fire__ (they respond to the same __scientific principle__; this is an __explanation__, not an analogy - it is __evidence__), and further claims that between two lovers there must always be a __similarity__, no matter how small (__symmetry__ is the principle; the beauty of the soul seeks beautiful objects; _this beauty is, however, occasionally concealed to the eyes - an invisible attribute; ibn hazm is always meditating on the boundary between empirical and metaphysical, between perceivable signifier and unknowable signified_); the premise is that __we bear within ourselves what our eyes perceive__ (and here ibn quotes the example of a white couple giving birth to a black infant; they had the portrait of a black man in their bedroom, and the woman would look at it); vision is __assimilation__ [_this notion is incredibly valuable; vision is ingestion - sight is somehow taste; unexplored synesthesia between tongue and eyes_]; ibn repeats that love is __overwhelming__ and __unknowable__.
	
10. (from "_the signs of love_" to "_the messenger_") like _vita nova_, the book is a __prosimetrum__; like its predecessors, it is obsessed with the __sense of sight__; here it describes the phenomenology of love from this __perspective__ - the lover's eyes follow their beloved object "__as adjectives in grammar do | accord them with their noun__" [here we find the conflation of taste - verbal, oral production - and sight]; it is, again, pseudo-scientific __observation__ of a lover's behavior; but love is a __contradictory object__, and it produces antithetical or ambivalent reactions (lovers fight vehemently, like __ice__ "pressed against your hands" has the effect of fire; _the multifaceted format of the book, between genres and forms, possibly acknowledges the epistemological complexity of its subject).

	- ibn hazm comments on his own lyrics extensively; he shows how he has been able to __incorporate multiple comparisons__ within a single stanza - love requires __multiple analogies__; its meaning __multiple signifiers__ [_unity in multiplicity is one of the philosophical foundations of the work, again mirrored in its form; is the prosimetrum a frequent choice for neoplatonic writers specifically for this reason?_]; ibn hazm also describes __emotions__ in fine __psychological detail__; the conclusion of the chapter is about his [very personal] painful __incapacity to weep__ (meaningful lack of a __signifier__; _the body is incapable of expressing itself_); poetry allows ibn hazm to __impersonate__ these characters, give them __voice__ [being other people - explore other subjectivities - being the multiple through the single, the single in the multiple].
	
	- the book then proceeds by listing a series of __cases__ - starting by the __oddest__ one, __love__ that begins while the lover is asleep (almost madness, pure fantasy); then love that happens without having met its object (through accounts of __virtue__; textual love, described in narratives and poetry); the love at first sight [sight is assimilation], and that which happens after long acquaintance.

	- ibn hazm at times quotes stories told him by his friends; at times he describes his own feelings and beliefs, occasionally in contrast with the rest; as he describes love through long acquaintance, he explains that it is the __measure__ of his personality - he is a man who esteems __routine__.
	
	- to analyze the __operations__ of this __mysterious__, demonic and extremely intimate affect, ibn hazm keeps moving inside and outside his characters - first describing their __phenomenology__, then their __psychology__.
	
	- the work seems to move from a __description__ of __passion__ [descriptive] to a __manual__ of __seduction__ [prescriptive]; he describes the diverse ways that __eyes__ (glances) can __convey meaning__ with a __maniacal level of detail__ (the eyes are his ideal object, since they are located between spaces - __outside__ and __inside__; they allow the assimilation of the external world - _outside-in_, while they express the operations of the soul - _inside-out_); the __scientific__ treatment of __vision__ (many reminiscences of dante) proves its __centrality__; ibn hazm's second obsession is __language__ - a sort of _bodily extension_ of our __bodily existence__ as well, as his examples of __letters__ written with __tears__, blood, saliva (and possibly sperm) prove; the final chapter of this section focuses on the messenger - whose ideal embodiment is the __dove__.
	
22. (from _"of concealing the secret"_ to _"death"_) the section opens with the __impossible secret__ of __love__ - the lover will try to conceal his feelings, but everything in his body will become a __signifier__ [although it should be remembered that hazm himself cannot cry; at times it is impossible to perceive - or to express - these signs]; hazm's focus is, however, on __secrecy__ - he tries to explain and investigate the reasons that lead a man to keep secrets; he is somehow __theoretically__ concerned with the problem of __secrecy__ - of __bodies__ that cannot (or will not) hold meaning inside (one of the first stories concerns __nose-bleeding__); he describes the process of __disclosure__ and its __causes__.

	- __secrecy uncovered__ becomes a __social sign__ - and indeed the following chapter, about "__compliance__," describes __love__ as the __socially perceivable__ disruption and perversion of customary __hierarchical bonds__ (mostly __noblemen__ falling in love with __servants__ - male and female; _society is therefore susceptible to the same set of principles described for love and the universe_); he then proceeds to describe a series of roles that harm lovers; once their love is __socially visible__, they are __vulnerable__ to the words and acts of strangers (liars are the ones most hated by ibn hazm - understandably he detests the dissociation between __signifiers__ and __truth__ (inner, social).
	
	- then ibn hazm proceeds to analyze the __bliss__ of __union__ and the sadness of __separation__ [two philosophical and potentially theological concepts; _the truly incendiary content of the book is perhaps its analogy between human passions and cosmic or metaphysical objects or beliefs_]; his analysis follows the same pattern - a combination of __personal experience__, __anecdotes__ witnessed or heard, __poetry__, __scientific detachment__.
	
	- the examples and cases considered turn the treatise into a broader meditation on __human affective life__; ibn hazm includes __nostalgia__ (a journey) and __death__ among the causes of __separation__; here, for instance, he describes the __misery__ of the __abandoned__ house where his family used to live, in cordova [his example of __separation__ is therefore at the same time __personal__ and __historical__; it is __social__ and __affective__; the house embodies the intersection between private and public domains].
	
	- when he speaks of __union__ and __contentment__, hazm seems to refer to his __metaphysic__ theory of love, the happy matching of two __souls__, beyond the limits of the __mortal world__; indeed, hazm unexpectedly starts talking about __time__ (divided in space, the two lovers are united in time); the greatest adversary of love is __oblivion__; the extreme consequence of its suffering is __death__ [love then eventually stands for a sort of __primitive, informing force__ affecting every aspect of human life, so much that its termination - and culmination - is death; there are many dense concepts here].
	
30. (from _"sinning"_ to _"continence"_) the section starts by describing the __opposite qualities__ of the soul; ibn hazm is describing the ways that sin can be avoided; __sin__ and __fornication__ are punishable, while - apparently - __desire__ is not [again, this is a complex theoretical moment]. the book on passion ends on its __restraint__ and __denial__; the tone remains the same combination of anecdotes, poetry and speculation - but the purpose has changed [or perhaps ibn hazm intends to emphasize the allegorical reading over the literal one; that is, this book is not truly about the carnal love experienced on earth - which should be restrained - but about the principles governing the universe].
