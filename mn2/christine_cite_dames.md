#Christine de Pizan: the Boke of the Cyte of Ladyes

##Introduction

- _le livre de la cité des dames_ was written in __1405__ as a __defense of women__; its main claim was that __women__ are as worthy as men.

	- the book consists of __three parts__, narrated by __three allegorical virtues__ [better, _presented by_, or _featuring_], sent by god to defend women - they are __reason__, __rectitude__, and __justice__.
	
	- its two sources are __augustine's__ "_de civitate dei_" and __boccaccio's__ "_de claris mulieribus_"; christine arranges boccaccio's exempla __thematically__ [she clearly divides the warriors, the rulers, and the holy women, in a climax towards the theological virtues and the fulfillment of a divine project].
	
	- the three figures visit christine as she is working at her desk [a reference to boethius and dante - although with an important difference; those men were lying in bed, in a state of passivity and despair provoked by outer circumstances; christine is actively seeking the source of her misery; she is __sitting__ down, working, and already in a state of intellectual unrest - pursuing knowledge]; the foundation of the city follows the __east__ to __west__ trajectory of the __translatio imperii et studii__ (from troy to rome and beyond, _a textual tradition, and a male tradition; for christine the political, literary, and theological connotations of this choice are all present_).
	
	- christine was born in venice, in 1364; she considered herself an __ideal descendent__ of dante, petrarch, and boccaccio [the last a persistent presence in her writings]; her family moved to paris in 1368; she received a good academic training, thanks to her father; she married at the age of fifteen [around 1380]; ten years later [around 1390] her husband died, and she did not remarry; she had some financial trouble, and worked as a scribe [the __book__ _the city of women_, then, is the material means by which she obtained her independence, the trade that allowed her to live and maintain her family without the support of a man].
	
	- among her famous works we find the __querelle de la rose__ [_in which she participated_ between 1399 and 1403], about the misogyny in jean de meun's continuation, and the epistre othéa [1400]. in the last years of her life she had __frequent contacts with england__, through her son, a clerk at richard ii's (and henry iv's) court. she died in 1430.
	
##Commentary

0. the "table des rubriches" anticipates a book about a __city__ - the first book being about its __walls__, the second about its __buildings__, and the third about __fortifications__ and __dwellers__ [although its real topic is the queen, and the saints that surround her; _the purpose of this preface is probably to emphasize the identification between masonry and writing_].

##Part one

14. the opening is __strikingly autobiographic__ - christine is at her desk, working intensely on the works of difficult thinkers [male thinkers, one may assume]; tired, she seeks the distraction of a small book of poetry; but she finds, instead, the misogynistic "matheolus," which she decides to read for _entertainment_ [the book was probably written with this purpose]; the fun, however, is short lived - she __abandons the book__ [an important gesture, hinting at ignorant acceptance] and starts wondering - why are male intellectuals so invariably misogynistic [the book does not seem written by a serious thinker, however]? her curiosity becomes anger [better, disappointment], her anger __despair__ - she is __persuaded__ by the tradition of male writers that women are inferior - and the thought saddens her [the intellectual premise, asking her to __challenge__ tradition and not to blindly __trust__ it, is radically new; that is probably why the introduction seems to describe a painful, almost violent process; she is using her intellect to interpret these ideas again - but that was not the intellectual custom of the time]; the first chapter ends with christine's lamentation to god, and her __wish__ to be born a man [are these both radically irreligious thoughts?]; her state of __unhappiness__ is __realistically detailed__ [__affective response__].

	- as in boethius [or _vita nova_], the allegorical personifications first appear as an __affective comfort__; but they also signify the human obligation to __pursue knowledge__ [similarly to philosophy; but also new - since this knowledge - in part divinely inspired - has to work against the authority of the established tradition], and the necessity to __reject__ the __mistaken__ prejudice against women [the interaction among these three levels is remarkable; christine is in the position where every woman could be - __persuaded by a wrong idea__ about her inferiority - _like the reader, every reader_; her obligation to __amend it__ is not only intellectual, but also __ethical__, __political__ - _and in this we see another step further, beyond the principles established by the genre; christine's exploration, like boethius', produces an identification of the reader with her - at the same time, unlike boethius, her exploration has deep, resounding social consequences_].
	
	- christine also discovers that her task is to __build the city of women__ [a political and social task], where the three virtues - __reason__, righteousness, justice [all presented in their allegorical gear and attire] will flow like springs [they are __gendered allegories__; the implication is that a __city founded by feminine virtues__ - a grammatical and cultural gender - will last longer than those of __aeneas__ and __cadmus__].
	
	- the __narrative__ now moves into an __allegorical space__ - the _champ des escriptures_, a __locus amoenus__ where christine must start __harrowing__ [writing, reading - __building__ and __sowing__; an endlessly metaphorical activity - _echoes of piers plowman's double metaphor for writing, plowing and pilgrimage]; their first conversation is on the __origins__ and __causes__ of misogynistic writings; as they explain these mistakes [improper generalizations, envy], they __remove__ old, useless - or even __detrimental__ - stones from the field - an allegory of __intellectual__ - maybe __academic__ work [the harrowing stands for the preparation of a speculative ground free from argumentative mistakes; no groundless contradictions, and no vices of logic - such as biased perspectives; it is a way to prepare the reader, to ask the reader to abide by these principles].
	
	- they proceed to __confute__ some misogynistic assumptions - the form is that of a __systematic q & a__ between __pupil__ - __christine__ - and __teacher__ - the personifications [boethius is the model]; it is also a __dialogue__ happening between christine's book and the __canon of authors__ who built the patriarchal prejudice; often the problem is not in __what__ they write, but in __how we read them__ [an interpretive problem]; she accepts their authority and even __literal meaning__, but she shows that they can be __interpreted__ differently; the greatest interlocutor is the __scripture__.
	
	- after that, they begin the discussion of a __political problem__ - women are __excluded__ from "the courte of justyce" - an actual, non- textual mistake. the response to this assumption is the first series of exempla - about women who were great rulers.
	
	- the metaphor of the __mason__ building a house, found in st. victor, seems constantly present here; the women start laying the foundations of the walls [the city is the book, but it is also the project of a city - the city and the book of a new society].
	
32. the stones used for the walls are the __exempla__ of good women; but the exempla are often __connected__ to each other, and related __in detail__ - using thorough __description__ and __dialogue__, creating a believable __historical__ and __affective__ context [a detailed narrative, not a brief exemplum]; the process is so __exhaustive__ [and the story often connected so well] that it quickly begins to resemble an __alternate history of the world__ - antiquity, __trojan war__ [maybe the most important book, at least for this section] - from the perspective of its __women__ [the amazones are featured prominently, as a __valuable predecessor__ - _a typological figura, perhaps?_ - for the history of women - and their city]; the virtue of these first women is simply __strength__ - they are brave warriors, strong __actors__ in the history of humanity (they are often __violent__ and vengeful).

	- after the walls we have the towers - to these corresponds the problem of __reason__ - are women "de petite comprehencion?" [intellectually incapable]? one important distinction that reason makes is that women are __excluded from education__ [historically and socially]; if they __attended school__, they would all be as __intellectually__ prepared as men. the reason for this disparity is __political__ [the same that motivated their exclusion from the court of justice]; women cannot study, and they cannot have the "experience de pluseurs choses diverses" that men have, since they are __confined__ at home.
	
	- many of the exempla that follow, about __wise, learned women__ in history, are supported by quotations from __boccaccio__; is christine employing his authority or is she showing her culture [as proof for her claim]?
	
	- the last two examples of learned women are __witches of antiquity__ - medea and circes; the goal is not to present righteous women [that is another stereotype, and irrelevant at this point; she wants to demonstrate the role of powerful women in history], but to prove that they are __capable__.
	
44. the following question is whether women can __invent__ new "__sciences__"; __minerva__ is a notable exemplum (but is she a believable one? how can christine quietly employ stories coming not only from __pagan history__, but also from __pagan religion__? part of her argument is probably that the __admirable greeks__ - _greek men_ - revered a woman; in christine's world all these ideas are __gendered__ - and their gender matters - _reason can be feminine; strength can be feminine; invention can be feminine - as concepts_).

	- one of the assumptions that christine wishes to reject most intensely is that women should only "porter des enfants et [...] filer" [bearing children and spinning]; the proposition is not only __politically detrimental__, but also prompted by "grant ignorance"; women are useful to society - "proffis" and "benefices."
	
	- the last question of the section is whether women have "__prudence__," which is a __natural virtue__ that cannot be taught; to do this, christine paraphrases the "livre des proverbes"; then dido and lavinia [follow as exemplary women].
	
##Part two

27. __righteousness__ replaces reason; the metaphor of the __mason__ now clearly refers to the __construction of the book itself__ - the tools are conflated with the instruments of writing; christine now has to build according to "__droicture__," the buildings and palaces drawn by her, and made of the shining stones of the __ten "sages sibilles"__; the "sibilles" are the proof of god's favor for women - they are the women who see into the __future__, who are projected into the future; it is still a matter of __knowledge__, but now it is __inspired by god__ [the idea seems present in the final story told in the _epistre othea_ - women who see the future, who understand _figurae_; the future is a projection of this collected past].

	- the next prejudice is again prompted by __ignorance__, and highly detrimental - families prefer sons to daughters, and the birth of a woman is not cheered but scorned (a __negative judgement__ for both her - the daughter - and her mother); after having rejected their claim, righteousness suggests that christine should start __populating the city__, where now one only finds __empty buildings and walls__; the women chosen to live here will live for ever; the city is therefore ultimately identified with the __book and its canon__; righteousness anticipates that the __queen__ will be chosen by justice; but they have to seek the __subjects__.
	
	- they begin by describing an __ideally good marriage__, and a series of __exemplary wives__; these exempla are all __female rulers__ [key element; the discourse of marriage is automatically associated with that of power] - __marriage__ is a __political problem__, and its unhappiness depends on __inequality__; good women - wives, daughters - are empowered women.
	
	- the section ends with __exempla__ proving that women can __keep secrets__ [_and give advice_, a cardinal social issue].
	
46. the question is not only about __women__ as keepers of secrets, but also about women as __counselors__ [the connection is the same found in chaucer's _marriage group_ - from marriage, to politics, to the problem of advice and decision; it would be interesting to determine whether those implications - about decisions concerning _allegory_ - can be extended to this discussion as well]; this problem extends the validity of the discussion beyond the __conjugal sphere__ - it is about women as advisers.

	- as the discussion moves to le "grant bien" that is caused by women, the exempla became __intensely sacred__ and __christian__, starting with __mary__, and tracing the role of women in the __old testament__ [it it is the beginning of the final section of the treatise, with the theological climax from the political sphere to the divine one].
	
	- the exempla of this section are also __politically relevant__ - they are powerful women who make __peace__ possible.
	
	- christine includes herself - and her father - among the exempla of why women should be allowed to __learn__; then the examples return to the __scriptures__, to prove feminine __chastity__.
	
	- the final prejudice is especially __odious__ - christine must confute that women "veulent estre efforcees"; the following stories, then, are __tragic episodes__ of __rape__, caused by the assumption that women desire it [the section about rape immediately follows the one about education, and exclusion from it; christine seems to imply that the prejudices that ground it are not that distant; the premise remains the same - women are not allowed to talk].
	
68. constance is the following virtue to display; the method is not to prove that all women possess qualities; it is to disprove __false generalizations__ - to provide new data to the __inductions__ that produce prejudice [it is a methodological critique as well; these bad ideas are the product of bad thinking].

	- to prove that constance in women is a requirement created by __inconstant men__ [a great argumentative move], righteousness starts listing a series of __proverbially bad male rulers__ [applying the fallacies of this inductive method to men]; they have been unjust with both their __wives__ and their __countries__ [marriage remains a __political allegory__].
	
	- christine now quotes abundantly from the __decameron__; the discussion now concerns __carnal love__ and __virtuous love__, and women's disregard of the common profit; having confuted this point, the city is __peopled with good women__, whom christine explicitly welcomes [and the welcome is, of course, extended to the reader of the book as well - welcomed to the city that is the book].
	
##Part three

19. __justice__ speaks to explain again her task - to bring the __most excellent__ queen to these women; the queen is __mary__ - and she is welcomed by all with a __prayer__, the __ave maria__ [a theological triumph that is reminiscent of dante; if _epistola_ is her _vita nova_, this could be her _commedia_]; to this mary directly responds - her answer is in the book itself, recorded by christine as "la response de la vierge" - endorsing the project and declaring her will to remain in the city; the following - and conclusive - exempla are all __contained in a prayer__, or presentation, that justice addresses to both mary and the women (in the book and outside of it); these are all __lives of saints__.

	- the conclusion is a __theological triumph of virtue__, and the foundation of a city that should not only be a model for women, but for every person who reads the book.
