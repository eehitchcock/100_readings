##Ideas

- Remember that the two moments analyzed by _Maimonides_ are the creation of the universe and the problem of its eternity (physics), and the visions of the apocalypse and the problem of free will (metaphysics; ethics); two cardinal problems of philosophy explained by the alpha and the omega of scripture.

	- _Allegory_ is always a method of _abstraction_ and _transfer_; it is the system by which we can apply the __structure__, the __organization of meaning__ found _in a text_ and apply it to _another text_ (forms, shapes; from one context to the other; _i am talking about something else_).

##Introduction

- moses maimoindes was born in codova in 1135; he was a descendant of those jewish communities that had transferred from the east to the west; around 1148, however, he had to leave the country, due to a change in the ruling class [the almohads, a berber muslim movement who conquered the city and abolished the dhimma] which triggered a wave of antisemitism; they [his family] settled in egipt [cairo].

	- in his youth he started writing __commentaries__ to the sacred texts; this led him to his first response to the __perplexity__ felt at the time by those jews who could not understand the ferocity of the persecutions, and [above all] who were advised to return to the __study of the scriptures__. his major work is an extensive __commentary to the torah__ [the "mishneh torah," written between 1170 and 1180], in fourteen books [and written in hebrew]; it was praised for its __insight__, but also highly __controversial__. this was followed by a __philosophical essay__ - _the guide to the perplexed_ - written in __arabic__ [judeo-arabic; that is, a dialect of arabic written in hebrew script; in 1190]; its purpose was a __conciliation__ of __reason__ (e.g. aristotle _and the kalam_) and __revelation__ (e.g., genesis _and ezekiel_). he died in 1204. [the book was then immediately translated to hebrew, by two of his contemporaries; later in latin - as the "dux neutrorum sive perplexorum" - and in spanish - as the "monstrador para turbados"; in this form it reached paris, between the xiii and the xv s., and it was read alongside averroes' works and al-ghazali's _destructio philosophorum_; it was the beginning of an intellectual unrest which eventually culminated in the __condemnations__ of aristotelian physics and averroist doctrines, between 1210 and 1277.]


- the purpose is to solve the __perplexity__ experienced by religious people [as they read the scriptures after having encountered philosophy]; its explicit project is to explain __obscure terms and figures__ found in the book of the __prophets__; but he addresses other metaphysical terms, and he explains the __system__ and __method__ of the __kalam__, the __islamic scholastic theology__.

- between the kalam and aristotle, maimonides preferred the latter; one of the __crucial problems__ was the __creation of the universe__ contained in the scriptures; for aristotle, the universe was __eternal__ [a dangerous, heretical proposition].


- in many cases, the contradictions between __science__ and __religion__ are originated by a __faulty understanding__ of the __scripture__ - especially __anthropomorphisms__ applied to god, which are explained as cases of __homonymy__.

	- in the case of __simile__, the two elements of the literary device should be first understood __separately__ [this is almost the same prescription found in hugh; the literal meaning - the thing signified - should always be present.

	- like hugh, maimonides combines his __literary handbook__ with an __ethical__ one [there are _some_ ethical recommendations; definitely not as frequent as hugh's].

	- his first purpose is that of __confuting__ the beliefs of __attributists__ - god can have no __attributes__; every adjective or verb used for god is actually __figurative__ [this is a philosophical problem as much as it is a hermeneutic - and linguistic - one; maimonides is now discussing the nature of god].

- the second task is an __argument__ about the __eternity of the universe__ based on both __sacred__ and __scientific texts__ [this dialogue is only possible thanks to the allegorical translation practiced by maimonides; maimonides has transformed the scripture into a philosophical argument; he has established a system of equivalences that transforms religion into theology, into a science that has logically connected propositions]; maimonides tries to use both at the same time, __integrating__ these perspectives; he eventually supports the side of the __creatio ex nihilo__, explaining that the passages of the scriptures that contradict this theory are, again, __figurative__, allegorical [but there is more than that; not simply the removal of potential contradictions, but the creation of a religious interlocutor; when they become figurative, these propositions allow us to understand new things about god and the universe].

- maimonides explains the operation of __prophecy__; this is a combination of __training__ and __inspiration__ [probably another practice that occurs between logic and religion; an enlightenment that is produced by faith].

- __imagination__ is a crucial factor of prophecy; therefore, prophetic texts are highly __literary__ in style [and literary _unmaking_ is the process that we use to access those truths that prophecies can reveal].

- the final part is an __interpretation__ of ezekiel's first vision [a process of literary unmaking, this time applied not to the moment of creation but to that of revelation, _god on the chariot of the tetramorphs_]; then he discusses __evil__ and __free will__.

##Comment

0. the __pedagogical__ purpose of the poem [treatise; the literal translation of the title would be "the one who guides the perplexed," their "dux"] is presented through a precise __historical circumstance__ - the book opens with a letter written by maimonides to his pupil [one of the two, currently in aleppo; he is apparently well versed both in the sciences and in the study of poetry]; the student is ready to move from __scientific knowledge__ (astronomy, mathematics, logic) to __spiritual knowledge__ [in this we find some affinities with the _didascalicon_, written some fifty years before]; the book is here to replace the instructor.

	- the explicit focus is __lexical__ - the explanation of __words__ that are __homonyms__ or __hybrids__; a __literal understanding__ of the _law_, combined with a true __philosophical knowledge__, produces "perplexity and anxiety" [like in boethius, intellectual incapacity produces __emotional__ uneasiness].

	- not only the __scriptures__, but the sages too (philosophical texts) use __metaphors__ and __allegories__ [does maimonides do the same? in any case, this contributes to the notion for which the biblical text and the philosophical treatises analyzed by the writer belong to the same genre; they only need to be decoded correctly]; that's because both __natural science__ and __theology__ deal with the __contemplation__ of remote mysteries; the metaphysical world needs the presence of the physical one [therefore, all texts, philosophical and religious, need to be translated; the vocabulary that they use is simply a convention]; __metaphors__ and __similes__ are necessary to our understanding of higher abstract truths [every piece of writing that deals with complex abstractions will be somehow metaphorical].

	- every word has, when used as a __simile__, a double sense - the literal one is __silver__; the figurative and hidden one is __gold__ [a simple but fundamental principle; the "deliteralization" of the scriptures not only avoids misunderstandings and apparent contradictions; it allows us to access more important concepts; remember that the __gold__ of scripture, for maimonides, is philosophy].

	- maimonides classifies __similes__ into two kinds - the first one is where __every word__ employed by the poet has a __secondary meaning__, discrete and original [this is the locus amoenus described by berceo at the beginning of his book]; the second one is where the image [as a whole] conveys a __general hidden meaning__, and the details and vocabulary used for it do not add any new element to that correspondence; it is crucial to distinguish them [at times some details __do not mean anything__; _a warning that reminds us of hugh's cautiousness when approaching this rhetorical tool].

	- maimonides has some practical recommendations for his readers; he insists that __every section__ of his work is necessary to its understanding.

	- the preface ends by listing __seven potential causes__ for __contradiction__ in a __literary work__; it is a way to persistently __legitimize__ the author's intention and credibility as reliable [always; if a literary text seems contradictory, we have to look for philological justifications, to restore its logically coherent meaning; this authorizes us to ignore every potential contradiction that we will find, for instance, in the bible].

	- his intention is to open the __gates of scripture__.

1. beyond the gates of scripture one finds __comfort__.

	- by explaining the meaning of words attributed to god, maimonides resolves ambiguities and confutes potential mistakes. [right now he wants to prove that god can only be defined through _negative attributes_ - absence of limits, form, time - and that he is _completely incorporeal_.]

	- the terms which maimonides describes as homonyms are, in fact, polysemous [and their meaning changes according to the person or entity to which they are referred]; it is a __philological__ endeavor, and its goal is to prove that every term which attributes qualities or actions to god is actually __figurative__; and the same could be said for __abstract notions__ used in the __natural sciences__ [this equivalence is bemusing, but very powerful; the discourses of science and those of religion are actually performing the same sort of intellectual work, only by employing a different vocabulary, and a different set of literary devices; whenever we talk about what is happening at the margins of the physical world, we use approximations, because language is bounded by material limits]; language, maimonides seems to employ, has a tendency to be always figurative [when speculating philosophically, we may add].

	- the notion for which __knowledge__ should be taken gradually and in moderation is introduced by a __metaphor__ where __knowledge is food__; that is why the teaching of __metaphysics__ should follow that of __physics__ [a very similar metaphor - involving "chewing" - had been used by hugh when discussing the complexity of allegory]; men need to refer to the __material world__ in order to gain access to the __immaterial truths__ beyond it.

	- the book ends by analyzing the __mutakalleim's description of god__. [the kalam's defense of god's incorporeality and the _creatio ex nihilo_, which is accepted in its contents, is criticized for its method; the kalam is not philosophically sound, since it bases its beliefs not on argumentation, but on a literal understanding of fictions and imagination; for maimonides, religion too can work logically; the perplexity is resolved by integrating the two methods, not by abandoning reason.]

2. the second book, similarly, begins with an application of philosophical doctrines to problems connected to god's essence, all analyzed philosophically [_unlike the ones asserted by the kalam; this is the pars construens of the book;_ maimonides is, then, using both __literature__ and __philosophy__ to determine what can be said about god; he moves from philology to philosophical argumentation]; the philosophy with which the book begins is physics [a description of the cosmos according to maimonides, and indebted to aristotle; it is very similar to dante's paradiso]; maimonides is using aristotle to found a __physically plausible christian cosmology__; he is trying to reconcile their stances; he describes, for instance, the interdependence between __intelligences__ and __spheres__.

	- the core of the book is the discussion of the __creation of the universe__, contrasting with its __eternity__; to prove his argument, maimonides often changes his rhetorical form - here he even stages a __fictional dialogue__ between him and aristotle [a __figurative device__ used to convey and abstract truth; a poethical encounter between the philosopher and the believer]; he supports the side of the __creatio ex nihilo__, combined with some notions from aristotle; again, to match these ideas with the __genesis__, some of the book;'s statements must be understood __figuratively__ [and this is the moment when the allegorical work of translation of the biblical work into a philosophical piece is accomplished; genesis becomes a reliable source, a confutation of aristotle, because it can be read philosophically]; the same is done later with the __prophecies__, which have to be considered __allegories__ [deriving from reason as well as from faith], using __synecdoche__ and __hyperbole__.

3. now the __instruments__ of philology (the nuances of vocabulary and the literary devices) are used to explain the apparent absurdities of ezekiel's first prophecy [the chariot of god, or merkavah, led by the tetramorphs; it is the highest moment of revelation in jewish theology]; philosophical theories are similarly used to justify some of its obscure passages [maimonides refers back to his cosmology, involving spheres, elements, and intelligences; he translates the vision into a philosophical exposition, coherent with his logically founded argument; __genesis__ was explained in the context of __aristotelian phyisics__; the __prophecy of ezekiel__ is instead used for __aristotelian metaphysics__].

	- the conclusion applies this method to the interpretation of the __law__ [after having discussed a number of sensitive ethical and religious assumptions, such as the origin of evil and sin, or the existence of free will].
