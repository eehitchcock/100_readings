##Observations

- "We have, after all, two options," said he. "We either favor the old, or we favor the new."

	- We were simply thinking, for a moment there, about Eleanor Johnson and the fresh ink of English Medieval literature. Things written for the first time. Inventions of language and genre. Something never seen before.
