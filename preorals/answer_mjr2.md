What is the role of affect in the York plays? You can write about any set of at least three plays.

#Affect in the York plays

Ideas from _Signifying God_; 

##Introduction

##Paragraph One

In her historical and theoretical analysis of the York Corpus Christi Plays, _Signifying God_, Sarah Beckwith defines the project of the cycle as one of "sacramental theater." She claims that the many simultaneous performances occurring in the city during this single day, and involving not only "a tenth of its population" but also a complex system of social and economical interactions, allowed the community to perform a collective ritual of religious identification. This ritual constituted a meditation on the sacrament of the Eucharist, remembered on the same day; it implied that the people who were staging and watching these productions would eventually better understand the notions of embodiment and presence evoked by the host. Besides, the performances paralleled and somehow equaled the sacrament of confession, since the performers and the audience were similarly asked to consider their own sins, and perhaps ultimately atone for them. For Beckwith, this kind of "sacramental theater" is possible when the two rhetorical figures that govern Christianity, synecdoche and metaphor, operate simultaneously. On the one hand, synecdoche is the trope that allows a community to identify with an individual; in the case of the York Corpus Christi Plays, this identification occurred thanks to the many "Christs, Satans, and Maries" who were wandering around the city at the same time. On the other hand, metaphor is the principle enabled not only the transferences of physical attributes and metaphysical sins that justified the sacraments of the Eucharist and the Confession, but also the very notion of Christian salvation, for which the sins of all mankind can be transferred onto the single body of Jesus. In this thorough analysis, nevertheless, Beckwith seems to overlook the vital role that affect must have had in the process of devising and staging these plays. A deliberate affective involvement was needed not only to provide an opportunity for the metaphorical processes of collective identification leading to the sacramental function of the cycle, causing the audience to transfer their feelings of love and repentance onto those bodies that were "signifying" God - and themselves; it was also a necessary premise for the synecdoche of the performance, that is, for the moment when the actor who played the role of Adam, or Noah, or Thomas had to reflect and represent the entire community. By strategically modelling the affective reactions of the actors and of the audience, the anonymous authors of the York Corpus Christi Plays effectively shifted from the remote transcendence of the Scripture to the immediate presence of the performance. 

An exemplary play to study the strategic modelling and deployment of affect in the York Corpus Christi Chycle is that of _Abraham and Isaac_. The exemplary story of the patriarch's submission to divine will allows the author of the play to guide the response of its audience from a condition of detached intellectual acceptance - or incredulity - to one of affective identification and ultimately pious love. When the play starts the audience hears Abraham raising a prayer to thank God.

Grett God, that alle this world has wrought
And wisely wote both gud and ille,
I thanke hym thraly in my thoght
Of alle his lave he lens me tille.
That thus fro barenhede has me broghte,
A hundereth wynter to fulfille,
Thou graunte me myght so that I mowght
Ordan my werkis aftir thi wille,
For in this erthely lyffe
Ar non to God more boune
Then is I and my wyffe,
For frenshippe we have foune.

In his speech, Abraham thoughtfully lists the reasons that justify his gratitude for God. His syntax deploys many causal subordinates, such as "that alle," "That thus," and the two "For," and it suggests a parallel between himself and God that is based on ideas of rational order; in the same way that God "wisely wote both gud and ille," he intends to "Ordan [_his_] werkis after [_His_] wille." Abraham now understands and appreciates the divine presence only intellectually, while "lave," love, is simply regarded as one of the many gifts that proceed unilaterally from God to him.

This exclusively intellectual response to God and His will shapes Abraham's initial reaction to the divine instruction communicated to him by the angel, asking him to sacrifice his only son. Abraham answers to this request with a feeling of cognitive surprise and wonder, but not grief; he is incredulous because the order seems illogical, "a ferly fare," not cruel. However, he resolves to obey to the bidding of the angel, and prepares his son and his servants for a journey to the site of the sacrifice. Like other unnamed and popular characters that inhabit the cycle, the servants seem deliberately introduced to model the response of the audience. In this case, they simultaneously express a firm determination to obey to the demand of their superior, because "To fulfille yt is goode reasoune," and a state of intellectual uncertainty, since "Bott what thei mene certayne | Have I na knowlage clere."

Both Abraham and Isaac remain in this state of quiet acquiescence and intellectual crisis during their long ascent to the hill of the sacrifice; moreover, this crisis never causes an affective reaction. In fact, both father and son decide to resist any sort of open affective display. After having asked his father to provide him with a logical reason for the sacrifice, in vain, Isaac states that he "sall not grouche there agayn," and asks his father to "morne noght for" him. Accordingly, Abraham insists that he will "noght gaynesaye, | Nor never make mornys nor mone | To make offerand of thee this day." Conforming to the intellectual theological perspective of the opening, then, the two characters intend to deny any sort of emotional manifestation in the tragedy that will ensue. But this intention is not fulfilled. Having reached the peak of the hill, and having prepared for the momentuous execution of the sacrifice, the two characters abruptly begin incorporating the language of affect in their speech. First, Isaac's "flesshe waxis faynte for ferde," and he realizes that "lyff is full swete," while "The drede of dede dose all [_his_] dere"; his visible fear of death, embodied in the pallor that grows on his face, and caused by a relatable love for the sweetness of mortal life, then prompts an affective reaction in his father.

Nay, nay, sone, nay, I thee behete  
That do I noght, withouten were.  
Thy wordis makis me my wangges to wete  
And chaunges, childe, ful often my cheere.  

Although he is still asserting that he will not hesitate to fulfill God's will, Abraham's speech is now very distant from the rationally structured, syntactically composed tone of his opening speech. The repetition of "Nay" is unique for the play, and it might in fact correspond to a manifestation of anger and dissatisfaction against God's bidding. Moreover, triggered by the countenance and especially the "wordys" of his son, his features change uncontrollably, manifesting his sudden and irreversible affective response to his grief. After having prompted the audience to intellectually appreciate the perfect wisdom of divine order, Abraham now instructs the same audience on how to feel what his son is feeling. This shift from an intellectual to an affective relationship with God is the purpose of the performance, as the Angel who stops Abraham from completing the sacrifice explains to him. Like the performance of the sacrifice in the Old Testament, the performance of this episode in York has to teach performers and spectators that God's instruction is above all to "Luk ye hym love, this is his liste." Through the affective experience of the simulated sacrifice, the rational gratitude initially vindicated by Abraham has turned into a genuine feeling of love.

This feeling love has to be represented and transmitted to the community of York, and therefore drawn from the remote, transcendent atemporality of the Old Testament into the present time of their performance. The author of _Abraham and Isaac_ seems indeed aware of the fact that the translation of the episode from the eternally valid truth of the Scripture into the malleable here and now of the vernacular performance involves a conscious manipulation of time. While Abraham's initial prayer describes past events and divine casuality with the composed detachment of the Biblical text, juxtaposing the present perfect tense of creation ("alle this world has wrought") with the past simple of his own old story, the conclusion of his speech introduces an urgent "Nowe" that becomes one of the structural elements of the play. The "Now" is repeated again in the last stanza of his monologue, and then becomes the first word uttered by the angel as he deliver his message from God: "Now bodeword unto thee I brynge." This monosyllabic temporal adverb marks a sense of urgency and presence that is then mirrored by an increasing temporal compression, evident when the reiterated "thre daies" of the "jornay" to the hill become few instants in the actual time of the performance. Time accelerates and decelerates in the system of the Corpus Christi Plays; more specifically, it accelerates and decelerates to create an affective response. The monosyllabic "Now," first introduced when the angel descends to Abraham, returns as the patriarch and his son eventually provoke in themselves and in their audience the affects of fear and sorrow that are actually instrumental to their conclusive appropriation of divine love. The adverb is uttered more than times in this short section; the most memorable ones, nevertheless, are those in which Abraham "pray[_s_]" Isaac to "kyss [_him_] hartely," and Issac responds with a "Nowe farewele," and the request to "take [_his_] swerde" and complete the sacrifice. The present time of the vernacular performance, emphasized by the repetition of "Now," is therefore identified with the time of lively affective responses, and set against the atemporal detachment and intellectual casuality of the Scripture. The typological story of Abraham and Isaac, the simuilated sacrifice that anticipates Christ's actual sacrifice on the cross, is therefore deployed as a model for two notions of time, eternal and present, and two kinds of modelled response, intellectual and affective.

This double model of time and response, depending on a learned understanding of typological history and on an intimate yet flexible relationship with the biblical text, suited well the guild that probably supervised the production of the play, the "Parchemyners and Bokebynders." Behind these concepts of eternal, intellectual atemporality and present, affective temporality, we can perceive the presence of two categories of readership and textuality, loosely corresponding to the customary connotations that the vernacular forms of prose and poetry had developed by the second half of the fourteenth century. In her analysis of the literary theory practiced by Chaucer and other Middle English authors of the time, Eleanor Johnson explains how, for these writers, prose was mostly deployed as a way to convey the perfect relations of casuality that informed God's providential and consolatory project. Poetry, on the other hand, could at times correspond to a monological, lyrical voice by which an author might attempt to prompt empathy and identification in the reader. An exemplary combination of these two modes can be found in the cunning narrative voice that organizes the distinct sections of Chaucer's _Troilus and Criseyde_. As Johnson explains, here the narrator strategically shifts between a detached exposition of his sources, corresponding to a "pseudoprose," and lyrical digressions conceived as a way to prompt an affective response in the audience. The alternation between the two forms, corresponding to two temporalities, would ideally model an ethical transformation shared by the reader and the poet, prompted by the experience of literature, and defined as "protreptic." In their manipulation of temporalities and affective or intellectual responses, motivated by two different experiences of the text, the York Corpus Cycle Plays seem to model an analogous project.

In the case of _Abraham and Isaac_, the manipulation of temporalities and the shift from an intellectual to an affective mode ideally prompted a positive transformation in the spectators, who ideally modeled their own 

 are the two key elements of the project of the York Corpus Christi plays, where, as in the case of _Abraham and Isaac_, the characters on a positive transformation is simultaneously 
 simultaneously modeling the transformation experienced by the audience and the performers, as in the case of 

 it is natural to devote the continuation of this analysis to the plays that expose the New Testament in the York Cycle. The physical metaphor for which Christ's body is signified by the body of one or more actors is crucial to the "sacramental" function that the plays fulfill according to Carruthers, as a culmination of the meditation on the Eucharist and the collective confession identified with the   

1. In her theoretical and historical analysis of the York Cycle, _Signifying God_, Beckwith...

Affect is not only the result of the York plays; it is, most possibly, its prompt. Its initial question.

- this is the __introduction__; discuss the historical context and background. an entire city identifying itself with the spaces and the times of christian salvation; genesis, the passion, redemption. 

- _briefly mention that_ the __symbolic relations__ enacted on the stage mirrored the __social relations__ of the community involved; 

- communal participation in the history of everything (of salvation, of christianity); __also__ communal participation in a sacramental system - 

	- It is a way that the community uses to identify itself as a community, as a distinctly Christian community.

	- A good item for the introduction, drawn from Beckwith - the number of satans and the number of christs that would be wandering about the city of York.

Beckwith explains how the York cycle works through memory and identification.

- "Christianity is a cult based on __synecdoche__ and __metaphor__."

	- Metaphor is a powerful idea for a literal, primary understanding of sin, affective transfer, and ultimate atonement.

	- The idea is that __metaphor__ is the way that Jesus assimilated and redeemed my own sins, the sins of the entirety of humanity, but then, in order for myself to be atoned, I need to identify with him; this might be a good definition of __sacramental theater__ - a process of identification through performance and identification. __Affect__ plays a vital role in this process. Not only is The audience is asked to feel empathy for the characters on stage; the characters on stage are asked to feel empathy for the historical figures that they are representing.

	- The question being like - _how is it "like" to be Abraham, to be Joseph, to be Pilates?

The three plays to discuss


- Conclude this paragraph with the idea of __presence__.

##Paragraph Two

- The possible idea being that the authors combine intellectual questions and affective reactions.

- Start with the __love__ bestowed onto Abraham by God; how it is embodied in a material presence (in a number of __gifts__ for him).

- The authors of the _York Play_ consciously manipulate __affect__ to produce specific reactions in their public.

1. One play from Genesis (maybe __Cain__?); _other powerful possibility_ - __Abraham__; Abraham is also the staging of the staging of __figura__. Abraham pretending to slay his son and producing affect in his audience is identical to the actor playing Abraham, trying to obtain the same reaction from his public.

- The structure of these plays follows a conventional pattern; we first have the main character presenting his condition, then a _break_ in the pattern.

	- Abraham starts by publicly thanking God for his kindness; not only has God granted him a beautiful earth, a beautiful life - and the __time span__ of a beautiful life; he has given him a son. Abraham explains the miracle that has turned the barrenness of his marriage with Sarah into a fertile union.

	- The first affect deployed by Abraham is a sense of happiness and thankfulness (gratitude), for the land, for the family, for the progeny.

- Then Abraham is called aside by an angel. The angel tells him that, to try his loyalty, god has decided that he will have to sacrifice his son.

	- The play does not __break__ here - Abraham seems to accept his destiny _without a break_, as if fulfilling a role.

	- The famuli seem to be deployed as _proxies_ to model the audience's affective reaction - identification.

		- The famuli are the first characters who apparently __refuse__ to conform to God's wishes.

- Abraham's first reaction cannot be one of incredulity and grief. Rather than reacting with emphatic sorrow, Abraham focuses on the __temporal distance__ that separates him from the space of the sacrifice.

- The important distinction here is the idea that time slows down.

Lord God, that lens aylastand light,
This is a ferly fare to feele;
Tille have a sone semely to sight,
Isaak, that I love full wele.
He is of eelde, to reken right,
Thyrty yere and more sumdele,
And unto dede hym buse be dight:
God has saide me so for my seele,
And biddis me wende on all wise
To the lande of Vysioune
Ther to make sacryfice
Of Isaak that is my sone.

- Here Abraham seems to be __explaining__ what is happening, rather than emphasizing his affective reaction to it. His reaction is one of __wonder__, perhaps intellectual surprise in front of an apparent contradiction, rather than an affective explosion. He lists a number of __rational__ reasons for which he is surprised; but he does not include his love for the son among them.

- Somehow, this is not a moment when the public should be asking themselves - what would I do? The public should instead rationally, somehow coldly realize that this sacrifice is a potential absurdity.

	- The relationship between the familii and Abraham and Isaak probably mirrors the ideal relationship of obedience against an unfathomable intellectual problem that should happen between people and god.

- The __Famulus__ stress the oddity as an epistemological problem; the problem of understanding God's will beyond the unpredictability/opacity of providence. God's will being unfathomable. Abraham's tragedy is initially framed as an intellectual problem - or a theological problem; not as an episode that should induce suffering in its participants.

- Here is a good way to frame this: "Bott what they mene certayne | Have I na knowlage clere." (121-122).

- The son is initially equated with the __things__ that Abraham has received from God; as a sort of material possession. God's request is not affectively disruptive; it is, instead, materially illogical.

And that is hythyn thre daies jornay,
The ganeste gate that I gane goo,
And sertis, I sall noght say hym nay
If God commaunde myself to sloo.
Bot to my sone I will noght saye
Bot take hym and my servantis twoo,
And with our asse wende forthe our waye.
As God has said, it sall be soo.
Isaak, sone, I undirstande
To wildirnesse now wende will we
Tharefore to make oure offerand,
For so has God comaunded me.

- Abraham seems to prepare his son for what is going to happen - he suggests that he would sacrifice himself if he had to (it is the first moment of _affective identification_ in the play - abraham plays the _what if I was_ - _how would I feel if I was?_) - l. 140.

- Abraham does not immediately tell his son that he will have to die.

- Abraham then __denies__ any affective involvement in the action

Nay, sone, this gatis most nedis be gone,
My Lord God will I noght gaynesaye,
Nor never make mornys nor mone
To make offerand of thee this day.

But then

Nowe farewele, all medilerth,
My flesshe waxis faynte for ferde.
Nowe, fadir, take youre swerde,
Methynke full lange ye tarie.

A, dere fadir, lyff is full swete,
The drede of dede dose all my dere.
As I am here youre sone,
To God I take me till.
Nowe am I laide here bone,
Do with me what ye will.

Nay, nay, sone, nay, I thee behete
That do I noght, withouten were.
Thy wordis makis me my wangges to wete
And chaunges, childe, ful often my cheere.
Therfore lye downe, hande and feete;
Nowe may thou witte thyn oure is nere.

And

My sone, be gladde and make goode cheere,
God has till us goode comforte sente.
He will noght thou be dede,
But tille his lawes take kepe.
And se, son, in thy stede
God has sente us a schepe.

And

uk ye hym love, this is his liste,
And lelly lyff eftir his laye,
For in youre seede all mon be bliste
That ther bese borne be nyght or day.
If ye will in hym trowe or triste,
He will be with you evere and aye.

 The conclusion is that the rational gratitude experienced by Abraham becomes an affective __love__.

##Paragraph Three

1. Affect is necessary to this conversion (from the intellectual agnosticism of the beginning to the full acceptation - guided by love - of the end_), and to the __making present__ of Christian history.

1. Explain how time is the what allows for the presence of affect in the play. It is present presence.

- Time is used here and elsewhere in the cycle.

Here focus on the frequent references to time in the play; the insistence on __now__ and __until__; the gradual slowing down that leads the two characters to the top of the mountain (hill).

- __Thirty three__ years; __three__ days.

- I would actually introduce __time__ in the following paragraph. Focus on the contrast between __intellectual__ and __affective__ disruption in this first moment.

- Possible thesis of paragraph two - the Abraham play manipulates time as a way to make us perceive the __present__ of this choice. Abraham's first reaction in his play is surprisingly unaffective.

- The introduction of the Angel seems to __create time__; to make time possible. The most frequent word used to open the stanzas of this play is __now__ - the play slows down to the present moment.

__Interesting detail; this was the play performed by the bookbinders.__ Affective embodiment of typology. Time seems to slow down.

- Focus on the repetition of "__NoW__"

- The plays therefore suggest that present is the time of affective engagement; this affective engagement is nevertheless necessary for the eventual conversion of intellectual agnosticism into love - the divine, ascending love for god.

- __Affective ties__ allow the play to function across time; to become an embodiment, a shape of __typology__. 

- Development of the analysis of genesis.

##Paragraph Four -  - Theoretical twist

- The play was performed by the bookbinders; therefore, we might envision a relationship similar to that of __prose__ and __poetry__ seen in some of Chaucer's works (Troilus and Criseyde) and Canterbury Tales.

Beckwith focuses her analysis of the Passion as sacramental theater on the body of the actor becoming the body of Christ, or being identified with the body of christ. 

- The chapter that we are interested in is __real presences__: the york crucifixion as sacramental theater. We start by explaining how Beckwith sees in the body of the actor becoming the body of christ, or - better - suspended between his own body and the transcendent body of christ, the community of york enacted a sacrament that mirrored that of the eucharist and its _indecidibility_. Beckwith, then, focuses on the body of Christ. __However__, I would like to focus on the bodies around Christ's body - to understand how, instead, these bodies and identities might become the proxy for the audience's reactions.

- Central step: the pace of the play as a protreptic narrative (__time__ being one of the central constructs regulated by the compression of the York cycle).

	- The York cycle functions by twisting - compressing, expanding time - just like the prose/poetry alternation of protreptic narratives;

	- this compression/expansion of time is what allows the readers to identify with the characters.

- To better understand this process, we might instead turn to Eleanor Johnson's work on time and protrepsis, in the fourth chapter of _Practicing Literary Theory_ and in _Feeling time will and words_.

In her analysis of the mixed form of _The Canterbury Tales_, Eleanor Johnson explains how... 

- Conclusion - __protrepsis__.

- __Present__ is the present tense of lyrical monologism; the unaffective agnosticism and acceptance initially presented by Abraham is the time of __prose__ transcendence - the time of god and history. Through expansion and compression, by modelling a sort of collective reading and interpretation of the biblical text, the plays shift alternate divine and human temporality, perhaps examplifying their potential compresence.

- The idea being, therefore, that through a conscious manipulation of __time__, the authors of the passion section of the York plays create a protreptical progression, leading us from an actual understanding - and love - of God's transcendent presence to a sincere repentance for his death. - to a sincere sense of atonement and participation for his death.

##Paragraph Five

2. Two plays from the Passion.

	- Examples: Joseph; Pilate.

- Mention the plays of the __passion__ (the canonical ones, including crucifxion), but do not talk about them; talk about two more characters, Abraham and Pilate.

	- Find a play where one of the characters might play the role of the dreamer/narrator of protreptic texts?

- Play one might be Joseph; the move from one play to the other emphasizes a break in the perception of time, the idea that time is perceived differently here.

- Stress that the _new testament_ section of the York cycle is all about misunderstanding, and sharing a sense of misunderstanding. The intellectual agnosticism initially presented by Abraham, Isaac, and their followers, now becomes anger and unsatisfaction.

1. Joseph is immediately a character involved in _mornyng_;

	- Joseph is immediately reacting to God's decision on his destiny. But his language is pervaded by that of affectivity.

	- It is possible that his presence on stage created a sense of dissociation between him and the public; in a way, the public awaits to be slowly involved in the present of _affective_ involvement, like for Abraham. Instead, here Joseph __starts__ with the _present tense_ of his unhappiness and mourning. 

- he is confronted with the __present sign__ of Mary's pregnancy (possibly a __pregnant actress__?)

But, Marie, all that sese thee
May witte thi werkis ere wan: 
Thy wombe allway it wreyes thee
That thou has mette with man.

- A pregnant actress or an actress pretending to be pregnant are indistinguishable (again, one might think of Beckwith).

That rewes me nowe full sare,
So am I straytely sted.
Now castes itt me in care,
For wele I myght everemare
Anlepy life have led.

Hir werkis me wyrkis my wonges to wete.
I am begiled, how wate I noght.
My yonge wiffe is with childe full grete,
That makes me nowe sorowe unsoght.
That reproffe nere has slayne me.
Forthy giff any man frayne me
How this thing might be wroght,
To gabbe yf I wolde payne me,
The lawe standis harde agayns me,
To dede I mon be broght.

__Joseph__ embodies doubt, or the potential for doubt. Joseph is excluded from the performative space of the play; he enters the play from elsewhere.

- Joseph is, in a way, a fully present creature - a fully __temporal__ creature. He is excluded from the transcendent time of divinity and scripture, and instead only absorbed in his own temporality and affective world. 

	- He cannot understand the 'prophicie'

	- Temporal compression does not happen in the plays where Joseph is present.

	- In fact, the play on Joseph's doubts culminates in a sort of temporal __stasis__; the characters are caught in the seemingly endless repetition of the same two positions of incredulity and faith. Without access to the temporality of scripture, Joseph is unable to understand the meaning of Mary's confession.

  Late be, for shame.
I did it nevere, thou dotist, dame, by bukes and belles,
Full sakles shulde I bere this blame aftir thou telles,
For I wroght nevere in worde nor dede
Thyng that shulde marre thy maydenhede
To touche me till.

##Paragraph Six: The solution to Joseph's doubts

- Here we should analyze the appearance of the angel at the end of _Joseph's doubts_ as an instance where, again, the angels alter temporalities. The "sign" is the potential for the transcendent time of scripture to inhabit the immanent temporality of mankind.

- Development of Joseph as being the affective proxy of misunderstanding. He is ultimately redeemed, and remains on the back of the narrative as the powerless embodiment of __doubt__.

ANGELUS   Waken, Joseph, and take bettir kepe
To Marie, that is thi felawe fest.

JOSEPH   A, I am full werie, lefe, late me slepe,
Forwandered and walked in this forest.

- What does the __sleep__ stand for? Is the sleep the sleep of a different temporality? It is interesting that, rather than occurring within a __vision__, in the transcent time of a dream, the vision of the angel happens - it __has to happen__ - when Joseph is awake. In his own temporality.

- __Focus on this twist, on this change.__ 

- Joseph does not immediately recognize the angel. It is the time of present - of not-angels happening.

ANGELUS   Rise uppe and slepe na mare,
Thou makist her herte full sare
That loves thee alther best.

JOSEPH   We, now es this a farly fare,
For to be cached bathe here and thare,
And nowhere may have rest.

ANGELUS   I, Gabriell, Goddis aungell full even,
That has tane Marie to my kepyng
And sente es thee to say with steven
In lele wedlak thou lede thee;
Leffe hir noght, I forbid thee,
Na syn of hir thou neven,
But tille hir fast thou spede thee
And of hir noght thou drede thee,
It is Goddis sande of heven.

The childe that sall be borne of her,
Itt is consayved of the Haly Gast.
Alle joie and blisse than sall be aftir
And to al mankynde nowe althir mast.
Jesus his name thou calle,
For slike happe sall hym fall
Als thou sall se in haste.
His pepull saffe he sall
Of evyllis and angris all
That thei ar nowe enbraste.

- The Body of Jesus - of infant Jesus - is the shape of affective incarnation; it is the body of transcendence occupying the time of mankind, being ultimately recognizable. It is this infant body that allows Joseph, and the audience, and mankind itself, to understand salvation and to initiate an affective relationship with 

1. One option: talk about Joseph in Joseph's doubt about Mary, and then Joseph in his participation in the Nativity scene. Perhaps conclude with that sense of happiness, that is nevertheless exclusive - something that we can affectively grasp, but not be entirely part of.

	- End with Joseph's anaphoric "hayle" - his sense of happiness and love.

JOSEPH   Say, Marie doghtir, what chere with thee?

MARIA   Right goode, Joseph, as has been ay.

JOSEPH   O, Marie, what swete thyng is that on thy kne?

MARIA   It is my Sone, the soth to saye,
That is so gud.

JOSEPH   Wele is me I bade this day
To se this foode.

That thusgates shynes in this place,
Forsuth it is a selcouth sight.

MARIA   This hase he ordand of his grace,
My Sone so ying,
A starne to be shynyng a space
At his bering.

For Balam tolde ful longe beforne
How that a sterne shulde rise full hye,
And of a maiden shulde be borne
A Sonne that sall oure saffyng be
Fro caris kene.
Forsuth it is my Sone so free,
Be whame Balam gon meene.

JOSEPH   Nowe, welcome, floure fairest of hewe,
I shall thee menske with mayne and myght.
Hayle, my maker, hayle Crist Jesu,
Hayle, riall kyng, roote of all right;
Hayle, Saveour,
Hayle, my Lorde, lemer of light,
Hayle, blessid floure.

##Paragraph Seven: Focusing on the language of temporality versus the mute signifier of atemporality, and the audience siding with the latter

- We should emphasize the contrast between Pilate's accusations - linguistic, and all focused on Jesus' manipulative use of language - and Jesus' silence.

- And, the exclusion of the audience from the circumstances that surround this episode - that begins _in medias res_. One should consider how the rest of the plays are somehow self-explanatory; Joseph and Abraham before him enter the stage and provide the audience with every detail that is necessary to understand their condition. Here, instead, Pilate is boas ting about his power and asserting how he is able to control the destinies of those who are sitting or standing in front of him. It is a moment of exclusion through power. The idea is that Pilate has power over the people facing him.

	- But this idea is paradoxical, because Pilate is a dead person. So - if some of the other plays instead enacted a process of identification with their characters, emphasizing the continuity between distinct circumstances in time - the persistent operation of __typology__ in making histories always applicable - here Pilate's speech underlines the limit, the boundaries of history. Immanence has somehow become meaningless in the horizon of the play.

	- The public therefore has to identify with the silence of Jesus. His only utterance emphasizes the distance between his transcendent speech - his mute presence on stage, that of a dumb signifier - and the meaningless immanence of present.

	- In a way, then, the plays are trying to push our identification within the present and __beyond the present__.

	- I would focus on the excess of alliteration when Pilate's speech is compared to other moments of the play. Alliteration, which the york cycle often associates to powerful men like Pilate, Herod, or the Jewish priests (and Satan), seems to correspond to the stasis of time that Joseph's doubt were on the verge of provoking. They are repetitive and ultimately self-destructive/self-denying. (It is a jerky form of repetition, a jerky, parodic, imitative form of repetition; it is devised to create a distance between the audience and the speaker). The York cycle deploys alliteration this way. It is the parody of language.

  Lordyngis that are lymett to the lare of my liaunce,
Ye schappely schalkes and schene for to schawe,
I charge you as your chiftan that ye chatt for no chaunce,
But loke to youre lord here and lere at my lawe.
As a duke I may dampne you and drawe.
Many bernys bolde are aboute me,
And what knyght or knave I may knawe
That list noght as a lord for to lowte me,
I sall lere hym
In the develes name, that dastard, to dowte me.
Ya, who werkis any werkes withoute me,
I sall charge hym in chynes to chere hym.

Tharfore, ye lusty ledes within this lenght lapped,
Do stynte of youre stalkyng and of stoutnes be stalland;
What traytoures his tong with tales has trapped,
That fende for his flateryng full foull sall be falland.
What broll overebrathely is bralland
Or unsoftely will sege in ther sales,
That caysteffe thus carpand and calland
As a boy sall be broght unto bales.
Therfore
Talkes not nor trete not of tales,
For that gome that gyrnes or gales,
I myself sall hym hurte full sore.

- Focus on language: __law__ is identified with it.

Sir Pilate, oure prince, we prelatis nowe pray you,
Sen Herowde fraysted no ferther this faitour to flaye,
Resayve in your sall ther sawes that I saie you;
Late bryng hym to barre and at his berde sall we baye.

- More focus on (spoken) language: Pilate asks his soldier _not to speak lightly_ 

PILATUS   Welcome, what tydandis this tyde,
Late no langgage lightly nowe lette you.

II MILES   Sir Herowde, ser, it is noght to hyde,
As his gud frende grathely he grete yowe
Forevere,
In what manere that evere he mete you,
By hymselfe full sone wille he sette you
And sais that ye sall not dissever.

The knights then remark how Jesus refuses to speak.

I MILES   For all the lordis langage his lipps, ser, wer lame.
For any spirringes in that space no speche walde he spell,
Bot domme as a dore gon he dwell.
Thus no faute in hym gon he fynde
For his dedis to deme hym to qwell,
Nor in bandis hym brathely to bynde.
And thus
He sente hym to youreself, and assynde
That we, youre knyghtis, suld be clenly enclyned,
And tyte with hym to you to trus.

PILATUS   Syrs, herkens, here ye not what we have oppon hand?
Loo, howe there knyghtes carpe that to the kyng cared.
Syr Herowde, thai say, no faute in me fand,
He fest me to his frenschippe, so frendly he fared.
Moreover, sirs, he spake, and noght spared,
Full gentilly to Jesu, this Jewe,
And sithen to ther knyghtis declared
How fawtes in hym fande he but fewe
To dye.
He taste hym, I telle you for trewe,
For to dere hym he demed undewe,
And sirs, thee sothly saie I.

- However, the structure of the Passion section of the York cycle does not ask us to identify with the affective present experienced by Joseph. Instead, 

- __Pilate refuses to use false witnesses because, apparently, they constitute a violation of law and language.__

- Perhaps Pilate. __Explain the importance of Pilatus in the plays__. Pilatus is on stage almost as much as Jesus in these plays; he is probably the second most important character after Jesus himself in the section devoted to the Passion. He is Jesus' main interlocutor. (This is a hard one.) Pilatus would exemplify the role of doubt who is not redeemed, who persists in temporality, perhaps?

- The play that we are considering, _The Second Trial before Pilate_, (it is one of the longest plays of the cycle) opens with Pilate and the two Jewish priests, Cayphas and Anna, plotting against Christ. It is a moment of utter differentiation between the characters on stage and the audience. It is a __slow__, prolonged agony of language and meanness; the audience is __forced__ to witness and tolerate the unfairness of the Roman leader, as if he belonged to a different time.

	- The idea is possibly that of __past__ against __present__. The thesis of the paper is that present and presence are the conditions for affective identification, and that this affective identification is what allows for spiritual enrichment - enlightment, for theological/devotional work; for a better relationship of __love__ with God (the ultimate objective of the affective trajectories of the play, as shown here.

	- In this section, therefore, the audience cannot identify with the characters onstage. We have a sort of affective hindrance.

- The fact is that the __present__ affect of this play is a present from which we are excluded; or, even better, it is a present in which our only possible __affective participation__ is one of anger, antipathy, incredulity (again).

- One might focus on the contrast between __spoken language__ and silent signs.

	- This is a moment when __words__ occupy the center of the stage. Spoken words. This is the time of __speech__ (different from the __physical__ small thing that was Jesus' body; different from the time of the book, the transcendent time of divinity).

	- The play insists on language.

	- Ideally, then, this is a moment when the public has to identify with, or to affectively respond to, the mute body on stage, rather than the people that are speaking on it. Following the instruction presented by Joseph, their eyes and hearts must be locked onto the mute small thing that is carried on stage.

	- Indeed, the way that Jesus' body is manipulated - handled - in this play mirrors his presentation in the previous play, that of the Nativity. Jesus returns to a state of muteness as he undergoes the passion.

- We are asked to align our alliegiances with the knights who have been conquered by Jesus' words and presence, not with the graphic, dissonating language deployed by Pilate and the Jewish priests.

- In a way, we are now able to identify with Jesus mute body, rather than with Pilate's speech. When the play starts, we are excluded from an ongoing dialogue between him and his guests,

- Jesus has __one single line__ in the play (l. 300).

##Paragraph Eight: Focusing on the fact that Pilate offers us an opportunity to __stop time__, reverting our affective sympathy for him.

- The sight and the speech of Jesus is the only moment of _understanding_ occurring on stage; it is, therefore, a brief moment of affective inversion, corresponding to another temporal suspension, this time accomplished by alternating muteness and speech.

- The sight of Jesus provokes a temporary break in Pilate's character.

PILATUS   Slike a sight was nevere yit sene.
Come sytt,
My comforth was caught fro me clene,
I upstritt, I my myght noght abstene
To wirschip hym in wark and in witte.

- It is now __Pilate__ who is modelling and proxying the reaction that the audience should have when confronted with the body of Jesus.

- The audience is probably divided between the inaccessible muteness of Jesus, a mute sign from a transcendent alterity, and the broken raging speech of the two priests. At this point, paradoxically, __Pilate becomes the only chance that the audience has to identify an affective proxy.__

- The first idea is that, after Jesus' speech, Pilate suddenly sides with him, and he becomes an opportunity to stop time - to revert time. The play functions by creating a sense of expectation and stasis surrounding Jesus' words - the audience has frustratingly been waiting for him to finally speak. He does - and only once; and his simple words are enought to persuade Pilate that he is right.

- Somehow, the character who had been affectively most distant from us becomes the characters with who we should we now identify.

- One possibility is that __Pilate__ is trying to stop time.

- Conclusion of Pilate; through affect and the manipulation of time we (the city of York) achieve a sort of sacramental atonement.

- The affective reaction is one of __frustration__.

- In the conclusion of this play, Jesus is tortured by order of Pilate himself, the only possible mediation that he can achieve with the priests.

- We could briefly refer to Carruther's idea of graphic violence as a way to become memorable. The conclusion is an amplification of the opening distance between the audience and the events occurring on stage. We could not be farther from what is happening there.

	- The shape of temporality and repetion in the second half of the play - the flagellation - is stychomithia. Therefore, the play manages its affective manipulation by presenting insistent alliteration first, and stychomithia later. In the middle of the play, we have Jesus' apparition and speech, a sort of suspension; we had been waiting for Jesus to appear and speak before that moment; after it, we are frustrated by his silence and the fact that the temporal identity that occurred, for instance, with Joseph, does not happen anymore.

- The play ends with the resolution to kill Jesus. The audience participates with a sense of frustration and grief.
