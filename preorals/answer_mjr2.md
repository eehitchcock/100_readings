What is the role of affect in the York plays? You can write about any set of at least three plays.

#Affect in the York plays

Ideas from _Signifying God_; 

##Introduction

##Paragraph One


- this is the __introduction__; discuss the historical context and background. an entire city identifying itself with the spaces and the times of christian salvation; genesis, the passion, redemption. the __symbolic relations__ enacted on the stage mirrored the __social relations__ of the community involved; communal participation in the history of everything (of salvation, of christianity); __also__ communal participation in a sacramental system - 

	- A good item for the introduction, drawn from Beckwith - the number of satans and the number of christs that would be wandering about the city of York

The three plays to discuss


##Paragraph Two

1. One play from Genesis (maybe __Cain__?);

##Paragraph Three

- Development of the analysis of genesis.

##Paragraph Four -  - Theoretical twist

- Central step: the pace of the play as a protreptic narrative (__time__ being one of the central constructs regulated by the compression of the York cycle)

	- The York cycle functions by twisting - compressing, expanding time - just like the prose/poetry alternation of protreptic narratives

	- this compression/expansion of time is what allows the readers to identify with the characters

##Paragraph Five

2. Two plays from the Passion.

	- Find a play where one of the characters might play the role of the dreamer/narrator of protreptic texts?

- Play one might be Joseph; the move from one play to the other emphasizes a break in the perception of time, the idea that time is perceived differently here.

		- Examples: Joseph; Pilate.

##Paragraph Six

- Development of Joseph as being the affective proxy of misunderstanding. He is ultimately redeemed, and remains on the back of the narrative as the powerless embodiment of __doubt__.

##Paragraph Seven

- Perhaps Pilate.

##Paragraph Eight

- Conclusion of Pilate; through affect and the manipulation of time we (the city of York) achieve a sort of sacramental atonement.
