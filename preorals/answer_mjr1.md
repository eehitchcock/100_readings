In her study of _The English Romance In Time_, Helen Cooper explains how the presence of recognizable narrative and rhetorical motifs in the composition, transmission, and transformation of romances allowed their readers and writers to use them as an occasion for ethical debate and ideological exploration. Cooper claims that, as the genre developed its conventions, the authors and the audiences of romances began to share a system of expectations based off a repository of fictional elements and metaphorical correspondences, like the "rudderless boat" that carries Prudence in the _Man of Law's Tale_, or the "fairy mistress" who tricks the nameless knight in _The Wife of Bath's Tale_. These motifs, which Cooper compares to the ubiquitous "memes" of contemporary internet culture, eventually transcended the discrete works and contexts for which they were originally created, acquiring a sort of autonomous linguistic value. More precisely, like linguistic signs, the "memes" of romance would progressively develop different, though related, meanings and connotations, which depended on the distinct historical and literary circumstances that characterized their distinct manifestations over time. The "rudderless boat," for instance, was initially mostly identified with the threatening unpredictability of fortune, and linked to Biblical narratives of divine trial and punishment, such as the whale in the book of Jonah, or the Flood in Genesis; in later texts where the "boat" appeared, however, writers tended to underline the salvation awaiting the passenger at the end of the journey, rather than the mortal danger experienced during it, and the motif became a reassuring emblem of providence. As they recycled and occasionally repurposed these narrative motifs, at times deliberately destabilizing their conventional implications, the composers and translators of romances would either meet or resist the expectations of their audiences, engaging them in a complex interpretive process whose ideal purpose, as Cooper suggests, was that of producing a pedagogically enriching debate.

One of these narrative motifs, mostly found in romances that elicited a conscious pedagogical response, presupposed the presence of "doubles." By "doubles" I mean two (at times four) mirroring and potentially interchangeable protagonists, who are often paradoxically defined by their lack of distinctive features, and especially of those features which would allow other characters, or the very audience of the story, to differentiate between them. Although Cooper does not explicitly discuss the historical development and figurative resonance of this recurring narrative "doubling," readers who today approach Marie de France's _Lai Le Fresne_, composed in the third quarter of the twelfth century, or the Middle English _Floris and Blancheflour_, dating from about a century later, still wonder - and, when possible, debate - about the role and potential interpretation of the twinning characters who inhabit these texts, and who make them memorable. To prompt and model this process of interpretation, the authors of these works often emphasize the conspicuous strangeness of the doubling characters, at times even suggesting tentative, though not entirely satisfying, ways to justify their striking likeness. Thus, for instance, the several hosts who welcome Floris and Blancheflour during their parallel journey don't miss a chance to reiterate how much they resemble each other, while the twin birth of Le Fresne and La Codre is explained as a consequence of their mother's adultery. In these two examples, "doubling" characterizes the portrayal and perception of two sisters, in the earlier work, and of a heterosexual couple, in the latter; in many cases, however, the "doubling" characters of romances are neither siblings nor lovers, but male friends, often implicated in a system of incompatible social and individual obligations. As I will demonstrate in my analysis of "doubles" in the two Middle English romances _Amis and Amiloun_ and _The Knight's Tale_, authors who consciously deploy this subset of the "doubling" motif usually confront their readers with demanding ethical or interpretive doubts, which, by taking the form of binary dilemmas, suggestively match the pairing of the two male friends. Moreover, the substitutions and identifications that these texts either evoke or enact between their mirroring "doubles" seem to thematize the problematic and shitfing identity of "romance" as a vernacular genre, defined by the translation, displacement and appropriation of foreign traditions.

While appropriating a continental tradition, and while possibly translating a pre-existent Anglo-Norman version of the same tale, the author of the Middle English _Amis and Amiloun_ adapted the formal features of his vernacular romance to the thematical "doubling" that characterized it. One of the most obvious, yet most effective, rhetorical strategies that fulfills this function in his poem consists in the strategic deployment of third person plural identifiers and verbs, in circumstances where we would expect distinct third person singulars; that is, to express the identity of action, thought and personality between the two main characters, the poet joins them under a collective "thei," preventing the reader from distinguishing between the "doubles." In the second stanza of the romance, for instance, the two heroes cannot be differentiated as they are born together, raised together, and knighted together. At this stage, as the narrator underlines, the reader does not even know their proper names.

> In wele and woo how thei gone wende,  
> And howe unknow thei were of kende,  
> The berdes bolde of chere;  
> And how thei were guode and hende,  
> And how yong thei become frende,  
> In courte where as thei were;  
> And how thei were dobbid knyght,  
> And how thei were trewth plyght,  
> The childerin both in ffere;  
> And in whate cuntre thei were born,  
> And whate the children names weren:  
> Hernkenyth, and ye may here.  

To further emphasize the motif of "doubling," the poet repeatedly introduces pairing phrases and structures. In this stanza not only we find the hendyadis of "guode and hende," a literal doubling of virtue used to describe the two heroes, but also the dual expression "wele and woo," repeated from the previous stanza (in a chiasmus, "How thei were in wele and woo," l. 12), and here standing for the entirety of the adventurous tale that involves the two male friends. Moreover, the anonymous author of _Amis and Amiloun_ consciously arranges the syntax and the content of the tail-rhyme stanza in order to imitate similarly twinning structures; in this case, the couplets that rhyme in "ende," "yght," and "orn" ("eren") all start with the conjunction "And." Alternating with the shorter line in "ere," this syntactic parallel prompts the reader to recognize and possibly vocalize a "doubling" structure as the stylistic pattern that informs the entire work. From a thematical standpoint, the contents of the two central sentences of this section are arranged in a chiasmus where the virtues of friendship are set against the interpersonal and hierarchical obligations of the court. To clarify, because the two "guode and hende" children have "become frende" in the first couplet, they will, as the second sentence explains, "trewth plyght" and always be "in ffere" (extremities of the chiasmus); but the causal link that justifies this oath is interrupted by, and therefore in contrast with, their social existence "In courte," which results in an alternative oath, being "dobbed knyght" (center of the chiasmus). The trope inverts the traditional disposition of the two domains, outside and inside, as if, at this stage, the public perception of the two heroes, their being "dobbed knyght," mattered less than the private indivisibility of their friendship.

This state of public and private indivisibility persists until, after having been hired as the dependents of their duke, Amis and Amiloun are assigned to different tasks. Like in the previous case, the poet consciously arranges the syntax of the tail-rhyme stanza to match the way that the two characters shift from a condition of intimate fusion to one of social detatchment.

> Syre Amylion and sire Amys,  
> He toke hem both in grete affys,  
> In his court for to be.  
> Sire Amys, as ye mow here,  
> He made him his chief botelere,  
> [Ffor he was hend and fre];  
> Syre Amylion, over hem all,  
> He made him steward in his hall    
> To dight all his mayne.  

The two characters are first joined as the collective direct object that the duke "toke [...] in grete affys"; but then, precisely after they officially acquire an identifiable social position within the structure of the "court," here explicitly mentioned as a dividing line between the two circumstances, their individual names eventually appear as the discrete direct objects of two distinct sentences, when one becomes "chief botelere," and the other "steward in his hall." In fact, the entrance of the two friends into this aristocratic system of privileges and responsibilities triggers a sequence of events that eventually leads to their physical separation, occurring when Amiloun is sent back to his own country. It is in the context of a potential resistance to these social constrictions that the story of _Amis and Amiloun_ challenges its protagonists and its readers with a series of increasingly difficult ethical choices. 

These choices are in most cases binary alternatives that match the juxtaposition between the values of friendship and love on the one side, and the loyalty due to vassalatic hierarchy and divine authority on the other. Like the notion of "fin'amor" in _Tristan_, identified by Sarah Kay as an occasionally "asocial or even antisocial" principle, friendship seems to constitute the personal and affective end of the moral spectrum implied by the romance. The several socially disruptive choices made by the two characters would then correspond to the gratification of an intimate and mutual affection, marked by the alternative system of "trewthe" that unites not only Amis and Amiloun, but also Amis and his lover, Belisaunt. First, Amis chooses to sleep with Belisaunt, the daughter of his lord, disregarding his authority; later, Amiloun lies while swearing on his identity, thus sinning against religion for the sake of his friend. However, in the climax of this sequence of ethical choices, the Middle English author of the romance emphasizes how the dichotomy between the personal obligations of love and friendship and the public responsibilities of religion and authority are not as easily discernible. In the conclusion of the story, Amis is offered a chance to save Amiloun from the disease of leprosy, which he contracted miraculously as a punishment for his false oath. An angel explains that, if Amis wishes to cure Amiloun, he will have to kill his own children and bathe his friend in their blood. While the Anglo-Norman version of the story concisely reports the subsequent filicide as an inevitable option, possibly suggesting that the preservation of one's progeny is a social, not an individual responsibility, the Middle English author describes the scene in fine detail, prolonging the duration of the episode and voicing the magnitude of Amiloun's doubt.

> Alone himselfe, withoute mo,  
> To the chamber he gan go  
> Ther his childerin were,  
> And he beheld hem both two,  
> How faire they leyn togeder tho,  
> And pleyde both in fere.  
> Then said he, "Be seint John,  
> It ys grete routh you to slon,  
> That God hath bought so dere!"  
> His knyfe he had drawen that tyde;  
> Ffor sorow he stode hem besyde,  
> And wepte with reuly chere.  
>   
> When he had wept there he stode,  
> Anon he turned ayen his mode,  
> Withoute more delay:  
> "My brother that was trew and guode,  
> Ffor me he sched his own blode  
> To save my lyfe on day;  
> Whi schuld y than my childerin spare    
> To bryng my brother oute of care?"  

Contrary to the swift and cold treatment of the episode in the Anglo-Norman, in this version Amiloun complains "Ffor sorow" and weeps "with reuly chere" before murdering his two children. The poet drives the narration to a moment of temporal stasis and potential setback in action, as the father puts the knife aside and stands motionless by the two bodies. Eventually his speech inverts the previous system of moral associations. In this final circumstance, Amiloun defines friendship as a debt owned to a "brother," and he identifies it with an interpersonal obligation. Besides, his obligation to Amis now coincides with the religious instruction received by the angel, and it is alternative to the affective, intimate domain that is instead embodied by the paternal bond. The author of the Middle English _Amis and Amiloun_ therefore deploys the motif of "doubling" to establish a set of binary ethical choices that is ultimately subverted.

Like the anonymous author of the Middle English _Amis and Amiloun_, Geoffrey Chaucer consciously depoloys the traditional motif of the "double"  in _The Knight's Tale_, in order to stage an ethical and pedagogical debate. Notoriously, this tale too involves two male friends, Arcite and Palamon, two Theban warriors who are imprisoned together, and who are then united and divided by their infatuation for the same woman, Emelye. Although Chaucer never explicitly mentions that the two characters should be regarded as in fact physically or psychologically similar, an identification between their two appearances and personalities is repeatedly and strategically suggested throughout the poem, shaping a system of analogies and differences that seems to consciously play with the expectations of its readers, in an alternation that is comical, puzzling, or curious. When the two heroes are first found, after the conclusion of the conflict between Thebes and Athens, their bodies seem to belong to the same indistinct mound. The two are found "liggynge by and by" in the same "taas," both pierced by similar "grevous blody wounde" and "Bothe in oon armes, wrought ful richely." Although less emphatically than the anonymous author of _Amis and Amiloun_, Chaucer similarly defers the mention of the two characters' names, and he initially deploys a third person plural that seems to join the two youths under one collective third person plural, similar to the identical coat of arms that the two are wearing. This hint at the tradition of "doubling" is then humorously reprised when the two characters, now imprisoned, almost simultaneously declare their love for Emelye. Palamon is the one who is first struck by the woman's beauty; when, a few moments later, Arcite expresses an identical feeling, his reaction is one of comical incredulity.

> This Palamon, whan he tho wordes herde,  
> Dispitously he looked and answerde,  
> "Wheither seistow this in ernest or in pley?"  
> "Nay," quod Arcite, "in ernest, by my fey!"  
> God helpe me so, me list ful yvele pleye."  
> This Palamon gan knytte his browes tweye.  

Possibly emphasized by the twinning phrases "looked and answerde" and "in ernest or in pley," and by the rhyme between the "pleye" on the "tweye," the comedy of this circumstance arises from the fact that neither Palemon nor Arcite wish to be identified with the motif of the "doubles" towards which Chaucer seems to be pushing them. The two characters refuse to be identified, and in fact their distinct reactions to the adventure of love that ensues seem to differentiate them further. On the one hand, as we know, Arcite is freed from the prison, but exiled from the country, while Palemon remains in the same cell, captive although allowed to see Emilye. Having presented their distinct conditions, however, Chaucer now directly interrogates his audience, posing one of the pedagogical problems for debate that, for Cooper, are enabled by the deployment of narrative "motifs" like that of doubling. The poet explictly asks: "Who hath the worse, Arcite or Palamoun?" (1348) The question might be rhetorical, suggesting that the two "doubles" actually correspond to the two sides of an identical problem.

##Introduction

	- Cooper discusses how the function of __romance__ was precisely that of triggering ethical doubts; creating curiosity for interpretation; prompting interpretive problems and somehow asking the reader to identify with its characters. What happens when a reader - or a group of readers - are asked to identify with one character rather than two?

##Paragraph 2
2. __Development__; __male frienship__. In two of the works that I have considered for this list, Amis and Amiloun and the Knight's tale, the trope - the __meme__, is deployed as a way to emphasize the ethical aspects of the story. Somehow a __doubling__ occurs for two distinct options - a __doubling__ that creates distinction after identity, and that serves an ethical purpose. (this is the end of the introductory section; here we state that: __one__, the doubling does ethical, pedagogical work; __two__, the doubling serves as a meditation on the linguistic, shifting identity of __romance__).

##Paragraph 3
3. First example - Amis and Amiloun. (We only consider the Middle English at the moment). Focus on __form__; explain how this doubling is presented.

__Form__

- One rhetorical strategy deployed here and in _The Knight's Tale_ in order to express the identity of the two heroes is, simply, that of deploying a plural noun and a third person plural verb rather than two distinct names and two third person singular verbs. As we will see, this simple device is consciously used by both Chaucer and the anonymous author of Amis and Amiloun.  

- The Middle English _Amis and Amiloun_ deploys the traditiona tail-rhyme stanza as a way to exemplify and match the thematical importance of the theme of the double. In the first stanza of the poem, the two characters are first mentioned as "the childeryn twoo" that will become the subject of the narrative. The poet therefore chooses to name them by deployng a plural noun and a numeral, rather than their proper names. The actual names are first introduced in the fourth stanza, as a crucial piece of information that the narrator, nevertheless, prefers to postpone, creating a sense of expectation in the readers. As in the rest of the narrative, the two characters should first be understood as the identical, indistinguishable parts of the same whole, rather than as distinct individuals endowed with personal features. Moreover, the narrator chooses to deploy the very form of the tail-rhyme stanza as a way to underline the element of doubleness.

> In wele and woo how thei gone wende,  
> And howe unknow thei were of kende,  
> The berdes bolde of chere;
> And how thei were guode and hende,
> And how yong thei become frende,
> In courte where as thei were;
> And how thei were dobbid knyght,
> And how thei were trewth plyght,
> The childerin both in ffere;
> And in whate cuntre thei were born,
> And whate the children names weren:
> Hernkenyth, and ye may here.

[lexicon: berdes, youth; unknow: unrelated - they do not come from the same kin; bolde of chere means beautiful; hende means gracious, noble valiant; goude means good - it is a pure __hendyadis__;]

- To do in this paragraph: explain first how the narrator is deploying twinning phrases __hendyadis__ (wele and woo; guode and hende)

	- Later in stanza 3 - the word "twoo" is repeated in an anadiplosis - as if the two characters themselves were born from this structural, verbal repetition.

	- Talk about the late introduction of __the names__ of the two characters.

	- How he is deploying the structure of the __tail-rhyme__ stanza as a way to formally imitate this doubleness.

	- Describe what happens in the tail-rhyme stanza as a system of oppositions: the stanza introduces some of the key terms around which the ethical doubts then shaped by the romance will take form - "friendship" and "courte" are two twinning obligations; mirrored then, in a sort of chiastic relationshio, in the "knyght and plyght" that follows. (the moments are in fact different - first the two children pledge _trouth_ to each other, stanza 13, l. 146; then they are dubbed knights, stanza 14, l. 164). It is important to keep them __separate__.

	- It is __crucial__ that the two friends are __not__ related by blood; this is what allows their friendship to be somehow entirely personal and uninterested - it does not follow or abide by aristocratic values.

```
- moments in the narrative that emphasize this __duplicity__ or __identity__.

- __ethical__, moral, affective aspect; there is the __heart__ breaking in two.
```

##Paragraph 4
4. _Binary ethical choices in Amis and Amiloun - Commentary:_

- The idea of wholeness - unity - in separation, formally expressed by a series of rhetorical devices and by the very deployment of the tail-rhyme stanza, indeed introduces a series of ethical conflicts, or __dilemmas__, that prompt the two characters to decide between their alliegiance to one world or the other. As they are dubbed knights and led into the social world of the court, Amis and Amiloun are formally divided for the first time[^note_namespaired]

[^note_namespaired]The two friends are mentioned here in the same line for the last time (stanza 23, line 285) before the end of the poem.


- Indeed, this episode immediately triggers the separation of the two friends. Their friendship seems here to play a role that is antithetical to that of social conventions and obligations; its role is therefore analogous to that that Sarah Kay has identified for fin'amor - it is a form of _antisocial_ devotion to a transcendent value. The choices that Amis and Amiloun have to make are __binary__ choices between the world of individual, interpersonal devotion and obligation (to god, to sex, to friendship) and the world of social and historical necessity (to progeny, to the vassalatic relationship). The choices are (we quickly describe them, without focusing on any for CR): Amis sleeping with Belisaunt (a __new trewthe__); Amis lying (is this a choice?); Amiloun lying (for sure a choice), in front of God; and the final binary choice, that between the friend and the children (again, this might be the triumph of these binary obligations - one is blood, aristocracy, progeny; the other is friendship and religious values). __absolutely deploy kay here__.

	- We __might think__ that these are simply binary oppositions, but they in fact constitute a climax that leads to a moment of ethical crisis. - the Murder of the two children. The gradual, sympathetic treatment of the episode by the Middle English author is one of the features that most differentiates it from the Anglo Norman equivalent. It is a __climax__ that culminates in an __inversion__ of our expectations; a conscious inversion of our expectations.

	- Like in the delay in presenting the __names__ of the characters, the author of _Amis and Amiloun_ deploys _timing_ and the expectations of the reader as a way to stress the importance of the moment, delayed and detailed.

> Alone himselfe, withoute mo,  
> To the chamber he gan go  
> Ther his childerin were,  
> And he beheld hem both two,  
> How faire they leyn togeder tho,  
> And pleyde both in fere.  
> Then said he, "Be seint John,  
> It ys grete routh you to slon,  
> That God hath bought so dere!"  
> His knyfe he had drawen that tyde;  
> Ffor sorow he stode hem besyde,  

- __This is possibly a moment__ of __inversion__ - that is, now the alliegiance to a friend is the social obligation, and the alliegiance to the two children is the affective personal one.

	- And here we have a close reading of the moment of filicide; first, the voice of god, the hesitation (a moment of self reflection, of dialogue between amiloun and himself). __emphasize that this is all new__ when compared to the anglo-norman.

- the final claim of this paragraph is that the author __amis and amiloun__ consciously deploys the trope of the _double_ to emphasize: __first__, how the obligations that the two friends have towards friendship, sex, and god (the ehtical world of decision, somehow) are _the same_; __second__, how this world is ultimately the world of the __self__. the fact that amis and amiloun are exemplary mirrors of each other implies that their obligations to each other are obligations to themselves, rather than obligations to the outside social world. __It is important that the two friends are somehow undistinguishable from each other.__

	- __Better still__, given the potential __inversion__ of the moment of murder - the motif of the double simply emphasizes how every moral dilemma can be ultimately turned into a dilemma between the self and the rest.

	- Isn't this, then, a moment of __construction of the self__ through the double, at a time when _doubling_ was not entirely possible?

```
	- Here we can stil use __cooper__: the __plot__ of __amis and amiloun__ follows the structure of a sequence of __dilemmas__ - literally, diadic options between two moral conducts, two alliegiances, two moral paths.

	- One is the __doubt__ at the end of the narrative - __replicated in the dreams of the two characters__; the other is the doubt 
```
##Paragraph 5

5. _Knight's tale; how the form emphasizes this break. (Does it?)_

Like the anonymous author of the Middle English Amis and Amiloun, Chaucer too consciously deploys the traditional motive of the double in his _Knight's Tale_. Like in the older Middle English romance, here too it is similarly crucial to overlap the bodies and the identities of the two protagonists.

- It is important to stress that Chaucer does not say that the two friends are identical; their similarity is confusing for the reader.

- It is possible that Chaucer plays with our expectations about the tale. The two characters are supposed to be different, but they end up being the same. They are identified in the space of the prison, they are then different in the outside world, as they fall in love and experience different destinies, and then they become identical again towards the end. Whereas the author of Amis and Amiloun seems to suggest a persistent identification between the two heroes at the beginning of the narrative, an identification that is then erased by sin, the two characters of _the Knight's Tale_ initially suggest this identification, but then keep oscillating between being different and being ultimately the same.

> And so bifel that in the taas they founde,  
> Thurgh-girt with many a grevous blody wounde,  
> Two yonge knightes liggynge by and by,  
> Bothe in oon armes, wrought ful richely,  
> Of whiche two Arcita highte that oon,  
> And that oother knyght highte Palamon.  

The discovery of these two bodies immediately sets in motion a persistent setting of identification (equivalence) and differentiation. The two bodies are physically identical - their wounds and their arms; but this identity corresponds to _actual_ historical and genetic links; they both fought for the same side, and they both come from the same family.

- Chaucer might even seem to be __playing__ with our expectations as he comically depicts the moment when the two characters both fall in love at the same time.

> "Wheither sestow this in ernest or in pley?"  
> "Nay," quod Arcite, "in ernest, by my fey!"  
> God helpe me so, me list ful yvele pleye."  
> This Palamon gan knytte his browes tweye.

The two characters indeed swore that they would not hinder each other in the pursuit of love.

- After their destinies have been separated by chance - Arcite is set free while Palamoun is emprisoned, they explain their conditions in detail - in a longer complaint - making them identical.

- The narrator explicitly compares their conditions (1345) resolving that their situation is probably identical.

- The original problem is a question of __precedence__. Who fell in love first? Might this be an idea linked to that of language and translation. Does precedence indicate possession, prestige, superiority? (Palamon comes first; Arcita, however, says that he loved more; Palamon deploys a legal system; Arcita replies with the power of his affection - and mocks the friend for having misunderstood the woman for a goddess - "Thou woost nat yet know wheither she be a womman or goddesse!")

- Therefore, the idea of similarity is initially perfectly justified and somehow not _mysterious_, not an __aventure__.

- Formally, Chaucer seems to emphasize similarity in moments of crisis; the captivity in the cell, the duel.

- One moment to focus on might be the "same wood" where they find themselves, the complaint that provokes agnition and which later provokes grief.

- Like in Amis and Amiloun, we have a _transformation_ that prevents the two friends from recognizing each other; althought this transformation, produced by love sickness, is not a separation between the two. Or is it? It is, in fact, the first description we have of one of the two characters.

> And shortly to concluden al his wo,  
> So muche sorwe hadde nevere creature  
> That is, or shal, whil that the world may dure.  
> His slep, his mete, his drynke, is hym biraft,  
> That lene he wex and drye as is a shaft;  
> His eyen holwe and grisly to biholde,  
> His hewe falow and pale as asshen colde,  
> And solitarie he was and evere allone,  
> And waillynge al the nyght, makynge his mone.
(1369)

- The transformation is what allows Arcite's physical and social mobility.

	- The trope seems to follow what happens at the end of _Amis and Amiloun_; the leperous friend moves to the walls of the palace, having become a beggar. (But here Arcite is performing this role.)

- __THESIS STATEMENT__: in Amis and Amiloun, the difference between the two previously identical heroes is a false difference in ethos (their , a true difference in language; in the knight's tale, the similarity between the two heroes is a false similarity

	- not a good thesis statement.

Chaucer then introduces the way that love changes and separates the two characters; then, in the moment of the battle, the two again respond to the same description, in a conflict that seems to echo the formal parallels deployed for Amis and Amiloun.

> O Cupide, oute of alle charitee!  
> O regne, that wolt no felawe have with thee!  
> Ful sooth is seyd that love ne lordshipe  
> Wol noght, his thankes, have no felaweshipe!    
> Wel fynden that Arcite and Palamoun.  
> Arcite is riden anon unto the toun,  
> And on the morwe, er it were dayes light,  
> Ful prively two harneys hath he dight,  
> Bothe suffisaunt and mete to darreyne  
> The bataille in the feeld bitwixt hem tweyne;  
> And on his hors, allone as he was born,  
> He carieth al the harneys hym biforn.  
> And in the grove, at tyme and place yset,  
> This Arcite and this Palamon ben met.  
> To chaungen gan the colour of hir face;  
> Right as the hunters in the regne of Trace,  
> That stondeth at the gappe with a spere,  
> Whan hunted is the leon or the bere,  
> And hereth hym come russhyng in the greves,  
> And bre [...]

> So ferden they in chaungyng of hir hewe,  
> As fer as everich of hem oother knewe.  
> [1647]

- Like in the case of Amis and Amiloun, The language is conflating the two heroes; Chaucer uses one collective third person plural for a simultaneous, identical action, instead of two distinct third person singular.

> There nas no good day, ne no saluying,  
> But streight, withouten word or rehersyng,  
> Everich of hem heelp for to armen oother  
> As freendly as he were his owene brother;  
> And after that, with sharpe speres stronge  
> They foynen ech at other wonder longe.  

Even the subsequent simile, with a tiger and a lion, in the substantial lack of differentiation between the two animals, seem to emphasize identity over differentiation. This is when Palamon and Arcite are one and the same. Indeed, when they are spotted by Theseus, who discovers them in one of his hunting excursions, the sophisticated (ennobling) feline simile is abruptly replaced by a more trivial

> He was war of Arcite and Palamon,  
> That foughten breme as it were bores two.  
> The brighte swerdes wenten to and fro  
> So hidously that with the leeste stroook  
> It seemed as it wolde felle an oook.
> But what they were, no thyng he ne woot.

- Physical change occurs, again, towards the end, when Arcite is hit by a weapon and falls ill. His "brest" swelleth.

##Paragraph 6

6. _Knight's Tale: Ethical valences._

- By this choice, Chaucer probably wishes to suggest that __providence__ is equally shifting. Chaucer might equate our understanding of the two characters as identical, as perfectly replaceable, with our understanding of providence - it seems to change, but it doesn't.

- The identity between the two characters stands for __providence__. They become more different as they are separated by __history__ and the deployment of their will.

- One might even say that the purpose of Chaucer's deployment of this trope is precisely to show how choice does not matter; how free will is an illusion set against the ultimately converging - levelling, unifying - forces of providence.

- The ethical imperative is __not to distinguish__ between the two, like Palamon does as he talks to Teseus.

> This Palamon answerde hastily  
> And seyde, "Sire, what nedeth wordes mo?  
> We have the deeth disserved bothe two.  
> Two woful wrecches been we, two caytyves,

- What we should learn is that, beyond our discrete understanding of events and individual preference for distinct deities, there is only one "First Moevere" for whom change is no change. (ll. 3020-3050) 

##Paragraph 7

7. __But__, we can also read the works as meditations on __translation__. Amis and amiloun and the context of translation.

	- Here we should bring __Cooper__ back

	- And Hiatt on genre and "romance" as the genre of translation and inclusion; and Field on the status of Middle English poem and the specific status of _Amis and Amiloun_.

- Not only does Amis and Amiloun exist in two, possibly connected, insular versions, an Anglo-Norman version and the Middle English one considered here; the story of the two identical friends had a vast continental genaealogy, from a Latin story dating from the eleventh century to "most of the written vernaculars of medieval Europe" [@LeSaux 1]. __The success of this story can perhaps be explained by considering this specifically transitional status; like the two friends, identical while apart, different and then restored, the narrative itself seems to have resulted successful in each of its incarnations, turning the hagiographical, topographically bounded narrative of the two lumbardian heroes Amis and Amiloun into an exemplary tale, useful in each of its incarnations._ As it was first translated into the French dialect spoken in Great Britain after the twelfth century, the story lost many of its specifically continental references, becoming a more generally applicable story. The identity between the two friends, later corrupt by the sin committed by one after the other, seems to correspond to the ideal correspondence existing between all these versions of the same narrative, possibly "lost in translation." Amis and Amiloun could therefore become a narrative about translation itself.

	- The story functions because the two friends are perfectly replaceable. Indeed, even sin is seemingly displaced, or translated, from one friend onto the other, possibly because the two are understood as being the same. But the fact that two different bodies, or signifiers, play the same role, or correspond to the same signifier, is possibly the element that triggers the nefarious disfiguration of one when compared to the other, and the fact that, when the two friends meet again, one is so disfigured that the other cannot recognize him. Like for its ethical contents, the translations of _Amis and Amiloun_ seem to frame a system and then systematically subvert it.

	- Describe how the leprosy changes the two initially identical signifiers. Compared to its Anglo-Norman equivalent, the Middle English version of the story expands on a narrative detail that might illuminate our perception of the economy of trasnlation in this story.

	- The plot motif that most easily relates to notions of translations and the displacement and identification of signs is certainly that of __agnition__. After having been apart for a long time, separated by the circumstances of fortune or providence, two characters meet again. Agnition usually corresponds to that moment of defaillance when the presence of this identifiable other shifts from unfamiliar to familiar. It is not simply a meeting of two friends long lost; it is their initial incapacity to recognize each other, followed by a moment of remembrance and recognition, that constitutes the trope. While the Anglo-Norman emphasized the violence of this instance, having Amiloun kick his transformed friend before hugging him sweetly, the Middle English operates a remarkable displacement of a small narrative detail, a cup carried by Amis as a sign that will allow their later identification.

	- The implication might be that prestige is now something that can be _bought_, it has been extended outside of the boundaries of aristocracy. It thematizes an economic, urban transaction replacing the traditional aristocratic agnition.

	- Not a very satisfying answer. The cup does in fact not solve the problem of agnition; instead, it triggers Amiloun's violent reaction against his friend. What solves the agnition is the voice of the loyal servant to Amis, "Oueis," who stops the punishment of his master and proves his real identity.

	- The poem therefore sets up a system where a literal and metaphorical translation are possible within a traditional economy of exchange and currency; but this is later challenged and subverted. _The function of the cup, that of allowing the two friends to be identified, is disproved._

	- Perhaps the ultimate answer that the romance suggests is that translation can only apparently function as a perfect economical system, but then forces it to its moment of crisis - a crisis that can only be solved by traditional means of reliance and honesty. __This might be the right moment for Trewthe and trewthe__ . At this moment of linguistic crisis, of linguistic adherence of the sign to reality, the poem reverts back to a traditional understanding of _trewthe_, the interpersonal loyalty between people, as if to suggest that, like in the story of Amis and Amiloun, signs can be exchanged without effort only to a certain extent (they are inferior to trewthe, like the economical, urban system described in the poem cannot ultimately replace trewthe).

	- The two ideas should be ultimately connected. The double system of loyalty and alliegiance, an ethical dilemma reversed and displaced onto the self in the conclusion of the poem, and the __translation__ of sin.

> Then was Amylion ferly woo;  
> Ffro his brother for to goo  
> Ever him was all his thought.  
> To a goldsmyth he went thoo,  
> And lete werke golde cuppys twoo  
> That for three hundred pound were bought.

> So quentelye thei were wrought,  
> In all thing were thei like, ywis,  
> As Amylion and sire Amys,  
> That thei laked ryght noght.

- One element to emphasize: the presence of a "goldsmith," the presence of an urban context, the emphasis on economic exchange, therefore compared to linguistic economy. _Economy makes translation and identity possible?_ 

	- While the Anglo-Norman version of the tale 

	- trewthe and trewe - loyal to a pledge and faithful to the actual truth.

##Paragraph 8

8. And The Knight's tale in the context of translation.

- __Genre__: in the middle of the second book, the narrator shifts from one character to the other as if he was shifting from one __genre__ to the other. We have the romantic plot of _Arcite_ (he is transformed by love sickness; he works for his lady at the gates of the city) and the adventurous plot of _Palamoun_ (he flees from the prison).

- Somehow these are two strands of the broader genre of romance interacting with each other; we might also say that Palamoun becomes a reader of Arcite's complaint in the second book.

- Chaucer explicitly turns the _false modesty_ of occupatio into a specifically vernacular problem. Insufficiency.

> Who koude ryme in Englyssh proprely  
> His martirdom? For sothe it am nat I;  
> Therfore I passe as lightly as I may.  (1460)

This mention is immediately followed by a reference to the "olde bookes [...] | That al this storie tellen moore pleyn".

- One option here might be to talk about how the tale has been adapted to become the romance told by the knight.

- __translation__ is important not only because this is _Teseida_, a boethian translation from Boccaccio, leading to the composition of Troilus and Criseyde, but also because it is greek history and classical antiquity. the idea is, again, that of translatio imperii. Does chaucer deploy the tropes of the double and agnition in the same way that we see in _Amis and Amiloun_, elaborating on ideas of potential substitution, replacement, and the misunderstanding of signs?

- The big moment of __translatio imperii__ is the presentation of the armies that precedes the conflict. Here we have a list of Greek warriors, and a description of their strength. Chaucer is appropriating them, as he has appropriated the three statues and the stories concerning them. Chaucer is appropriating them for a different vernacular, a different audience, and ultimately a different purpose.

- What matters at this point is not the space of history, where the two characters are virtually interchangeable, but instead the space of private complaint, where their distinct personalities develop. _Therefore_, the idea might seem that, although the ethical understanding of the tale might suggest that the two characters are actually the same, the moments that matter the most for Chaucer's authorship are those where they are different - where they look, act, and speak differently. The _emotional_ core of the story is the adaptation of Boethius and the insertion of the lyrical complaints, not the historical triumphalism of the two armies facing each other.

- The author of Amis and Amiloun, writing at the beginning of s. XIV, is ultimately insecure about the role of his vernacular when this is introduced in a complex linguistic economy. Somehow, the production of a new piece might create misunderstandings and ultimately be rejected. Therefore, the ethical world of the story stresses the positivity of difference, whereas the linguistic project strives for uniformity. On the other hand, Chaucer's knight have to be understood as identical in order for the story to function and teach something to the readers; but the most important moments of the narrative are not those of traditional epic, but the personal and lyrical complaints - the subjectivity that had differentiated the two heroes. For the anonymous author of Amis and Amiloun, the fact that he has written a story that intends to appropriate and replace a previous tradition is a sign of inferiority (lingustic and perhaps cultural); for Chaucer, the differences of his translation are an element of richness.

- The most memorable moments of _The Knight's Tale_ are those when the two characters are separated and suffering - the lyrical moments of monologue and exchange that rewrite Boethius; not the battles that pedestrially conform to the _translatio imperii_.

- Indeed, the third part of the story seems a display of this _translatio_, 

> Ye knowen wel that every lusty knyght  
> That loveth paramours and hath his myght,  
> Were it in Engelond or elleswhere,  
> They wolde, hir thankes, wilnen to be there -  
> To fighte for a lady, benedicitee!  
> It were a lusty sighte for to see.  

- It is worth noticing that the fighters involved in the battle, Lygurge and Emetreus, are somehow monstrous caricatures, perhaps amplifying the animal parallels deployed in the sequence when they meet Theseus.

- Indeed, the triumph of the confusion between the two heroes is the fact that _Palamon_ seeks Venus, while Arcite seeks _Mars_. 

- For Chaucer, writing at least seven decades after the anonymous author of Amis and Amiloun, the physical identity between his two main characters is no longer a source of wonder, but seemingly one of ridicule.

- sites of misunderstanding might be the prayers.

- Arcite initially misunderstands the meaning of his friend's "A!"

- Palamoun misunderstands Emilie for a goddess.

	- Perhaps we might say that the context had changed by the late xiv s., and the status of english had risen to be able to displace the authority and the prestige of the previous traditions, to displace italian, latin, greek.

	- Chaucer emphasizes the chronological and spatial distance of his source and matter in the first section of the poem.

- Perhaps the _translation_ and the failed agnition work as signifiers for __genre__ in the work. Arcite's transformation would therefore match a transformation of the original romance into a work of philosophical debate - a meditation on providence and __free will__. (The idea is certainly that of __free will__ against providence.)

	- Not only is Chaucer translating from Boccaccio; he is adding new sources and a Boethian reading of the whole theme.

##Paragraph 9

9. Conclusion.

__Two works__: options.

1. Amis and Amiloun (doubled);
2. Knight's tale (providence, religion interwoven; here the theme of doubling resonates with that of friendship, in a different context; adaptation and translation from the original);
	

__Envoy__: bisclavret.

##Structure

- Amis and Amiloun and Chaucer's _Knight's tale_ do similar stuff from an ethical perspective; they have two almost indistinguishable characters who are led to identity first, difference later - they seem to embody a sort of reaction to fate.

	- __But__, the two works could also be read as meditations on __translation__ and __glossing__; they both come from a continental tradition. Chaucer is adapting Boccaccio, he is also working along a line of __translatio imperiii__.

	One - Ethical doubt. Therefore, _Romance_ is the genre that enables us to confront ethical dilemmas.

		- In _Amis and Amiloun_, this ethical dilemma is also a dilemma of alliegiance - and transference of sin, vassalatic and not, from one body to the other. Do I owe my alliegiance to the king/the count/the vassalatic structure that I inhabit? Or do I owe my alliegiance to the god/to love/to friensdship?

		- In _Knight's tale_, the ethical dilemma is a retelling of Boethian providence. The idea is that the two friends are somehow indistinguishable, and confusing, because they are part of the same oneness - the same abstract, distant providence.

		- The trope - the __meme__, for _Helen Cooper_, of __oneness__ - of similarity, almost identity, is deployed as a
