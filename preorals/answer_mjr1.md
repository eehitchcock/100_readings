Many of the works on this list have doubled or transformed masculine figures: a few examples are Amis and Amiloun, Guy before marriage and Guy after marriage, Tristan and Tristan l’Amerus, Palamon and Arcite, Arveragus and Aurelius. Choose two works from your list that are in the general vicinity of romance (avoiding, for example, Nicholas and Absolon from the Miller’s Tale) and examine how each work deploys its doubled masculine figures. For example—but your questions could well be different from these—How does the doubling facilitate or complicate each work’s potential for exemplarity? Does doubling express certain thematic tensions, such as between secular and religious imperatives? Does doubling explore a thematic interest in something beyond the plot itself, such as glossing or translation? No need to answer every conceivable question in your essay: the goal is to develop an analysis of the two chosen works that brings out each work’s particular qualities and strategies. In the course of your analysis, draw on two of the secondary sources for this part of the major list.

##Introduction
1. Introduction; the trope of identity as a sort of __meme__, a recognizable feature of the genre that exists somehow outside of it.

	- Cooper discusses how the function of __romance__ was precisely that of triggering ethical doubts; creating curiosity for interpretation; prompting interpretive problems and somehow asking the reader to identify with its characters. What happens when a reader - or a group of readers - are asked to identify with one character rather than two?

	- We can quickly bring in a number of secondary examples that will not be discussed - the recognizably linked __Floris and Blancheflour__, and some of the lais by __MdF__.


##Paragraph 2
2. __Development__; __male frienship__. In two of the works that I have considered for this list, Amis and Amiloun and the Knight's tale, the trope - the __meme__, is deployed as a way to emphasize the ethical aspects of the story. Somehow a __doubling__ occurs for two distinct options - a __doubling__ that creates distinction after identity, and that serves an ethical purpose. (this is the end of the introductory section; here we state that: __one__, the doubling does ethical, pedagogical work; __two__, the doubling serves as a meditation on the linguistic, shifting identity of __romance__).

##Paragraph 3
3. First example - Amis and Amiloun. (We only consider the Middle English at the moment). Focus on __form__; explain how this doubling is presented.

__Form__

- The Middle English _Amis and Amiloun_ deploys the traditiona tail-rhyme stanza as a way to exemplify and match the thematical importance of the theme of the double. In the first stanza of the poem, the two characters are first mentioned as "the childeryn twoo" that will become the subject of the narrative. The poet therefore chooses to name them by deployng a plural noun and a numeral, rather than their proper names. The actual names are first introduced in the fourth stanza, as a crucial piece of information that the narrator, nevertheless, prefers to postpone, creating a sense of expectation in the readers. As in the rest of the narrative, the two characters should first be understood as the identical, indistinguishable parts of the same whole, rather than as distinct individuals endowed with personal features. Moreover, the narrator chooses to deploy the very form of the tail-rhyme stanza as a way to underline the element of doubleness.

> In wele and woo how thei gone wende,  
> And howe unknow thei were of kende,  
> The berdes bolde of chere;
> And how thei were guode and hende,
> And how yong thei become frende,
> In courte where as thei were;
> And how thei were dobbid knyght,
> And how thei were trewth plyght,
> The childerin both in ffere;
> And in whate cuntre thei were born,
> And whate the children names weren:
> Hernkenyth, and ye may here.

[lexicon: berdes, youth; unknow: unrelated - they do not come from the same kin; bolde of chere means beautiful; hende means gracious, noble valiant; goude means good - it is a pure __hendyadis__;]

	- To do in this paragraph: explain first how the narrator is deploying twinning phrases __hendyadis__ (wele and woo; guode and hende)

	- Later in stanza 3 - the word "twoo" is repeated in an anadiplosis - as if the two characters themselves were born from this structural, verbal repetition.

	- Talk about the late introduction of __the names__ of the two characters.

	- How he is deploying the structure of the __tail-rhyme__ stanza as a way to formally imitate this doubleness.

	- Describe what happens in the tail-rhyme stanza as a system of oppositions: the stanza introduces some of the key terms around which the ethical doubts then shaped by the romance will take form - "friendship" and "courte" are two twinning obligations; mirrored then, in a sort of chiastic relationshio, in the "knyght and plyght" that follows. (the moments are in fact different - first the two children pledge _trouth_ to each other, stanza 13, l. 146; then they are dubbed knights, stanza 14, l. 164). It is important to keep them __separate__.

	- It is __crucial__ that the two friends are __not__ related by blood; this is what allows their friendship to be somehow entirely personal and uninterested - it does not follow or abide by aristocratic values.

```
	- moments in the narrative that emphasize this __duplicity__ or __identity__.

	- __ethical__, moral, affective aspect; there is the __heart__ breaking in two.
```

##Paragraph 4
4. _Binary ethical choices in Amis and Amiloun - Commentary:_

- The idea of wholeness - unity - in separation, formally expressed by a series of rhetorical devices and by the very deployment of the tail-rhyme stanza, indeed introduces a series of ethical conflicts, or __dilemmas__, that prompt the two characters to decide between their alliegiance to one world or the other. As they are dubbed knights and led into the social world of the court, Amis and Amiloun are formally divided for the first time[^note_namespaired]

[^note_namespaired]The two friends are mentioned here in the same line for the last time (stanza 23, line 285) before the end of the poem.

> Sire Amys, as ye mow here,  
> He made him his chief botelere,  
> [Ffor he was hend and fre];  
> Syre Amylion, over hem all,  
> He made him steward in his hall  
> To dight all his mayne.

Indeed, this episode immediately triggers the separation of the two friends. Their friendship seems here to play a role that is antithetical to that of social conventions and obligations; its role is therefore analogous to that that Sarah Kay has identified for fin'amor - it is a form of _antisocial_ devotion to a transcendent value. The choices that Amis and Amiloun have to make are __binary__ choices between the world of individual, interpersonal devotion and obligation (to god, to sex, to friendship) and the world of social and historical necessity (to progeny, to the vassalatic relationship). The choices are (we quickly describe them, without focusing on any for CR): Amis sleeping with Belisaunt (a __new trewthe__); Amis lying (is this a choice?); Amiloun lying (for sure a choice), in front of God; and the final binary choice, that between the friend and the children (again, this might be the triumph of these binary obligations - one is blood, aristocracy, progeny; the other is friendship and religious values). __absolutely deploy kay here__.

	- We __might think__ that these are simply binary oppositions, but they in fact constitute a climax that leads to a moment of ethical crisis. - the Murder of the two children. The gradual, sympathetic treatment of the episode by the Middle English author is one of the features that most differentiates it from the Anglo Norman equivalent. It is a __climax__ that culminates in an __inversion__ of our expectations; a conscious inversion of our expectations.

	- Like in the delay in presenting the __names__ of the characters, the author of _Amis and Amiloun_ deploys _timing_ and the expectations of the reader as a way to stress the importance of the moment, delayed and detailed.

> Alone himselfe, withoute mo,  
> To the chamber he gan go  
> Ther his childerin were,  
> And he beheld hem both two,  
> How faire they leyn togeder tho,  
> And pleyde both in fere.  
> Then said he, "Be seint John,  
> It ys grete routh you to slon,  
> That God hath bought so dere!"  
> His knyfe he had drawen that tyde;  
> Ffor sorow he stode hem besyde,  

- __This is possibly a moment__ of __inversion__ - that is, now the alliegiance to a friend is the social obligation, and the alliegiance to the two children is the affective personal one.

	- And here we have a close reading of the moment of filicide; first, the voice of god, the hesitation (a moment of self reflection, of dialogue between amiloun and himself). __emphasize that this is all new__ when compared to the anglo-norman.

- the final claim of this paragraph is that the author __amis and amiloun__ consciously deploys the trope of the _double_ to emphasize: __first__, how the obligations that the two friends have towards friendship, sex, and god (the ehtical world of decision, somehow) are _the same_; __second__, how this world is ultimately the world of the __self__. the fact that amis and amiloun are exemplary mirrors of each other implies that their obligations to each other are obligations to themselves, rather than obligations to the outside social world. __It is important that the two friends are somehow undistinguishable from each other.__

	- __Better still__, given the potential __inversion__ of the moment of murder - the motif of the double simply emphasizes how every moral dilemma can be ultimately turned into a dilemma between the self and the rest.

	- Isn't this, then, a moment of __construction of the self__ through the double, at a time when _doubling_ was not entirely possible?

```
	- Here we can stil use __cooper__: the __plot__ of __amis and amiloun__ follows the structure of a sequence of __dilemmas__ - literally, diadic options between two moral conducts, two alliegiances, two moral paths.

	- One is the __doubt__ at the end of the narrative - __replicated in the dreams of the two characters__; the other is the doubt 
```
##Paragraph 5

5. _Knight's tale; how the form emphasizes this break. (Does it?)_

Like the anonymous author of the Middle English Amis and Amiloun, Chaucer too consciously deploys the traditional motive of the double in his _Knight's Tale_. Like in the older Middle English romance, here too it is similarly crucial to overlap the bodies and the identities of the two protagonists.

- It is possible that Chaucer plays with our expectations about the tale. The two characters are supposed to be different, but they end up being the same. They are identified in the space of the prison, they are then different in the outside world, as they fall in love and experience different destinies, and then they become identical again towards the end. Whereas the author of Amis and Amiloun seems to suggest a persistent identification between the two heroes at the beginning of the narrative, an identification that is then erased by sin, the two characters of _the Knight's Tale_ initially suggest this identification, but then keep oscillating between being different and being ultimately the same.

> And so bifel that in the taas they founde,  
> Thurgh-girt with many a grevous blody wounde,  
> Two yonge knightes liggynge by and by,  
> Bothe in oon armes, wrought ful richely,  
> Of whiche two Arcita highte that oon,  
> And that oother knyght highte Palamon.  

The discovery of these two bodies immediately sets in motion a persistent setting of identification (equivalence) and differentiation. The two bodies are physically identical - their 

- Formally, Chaucer seems to emphasize similarity in moments of crisis; the captivity in the cell, the duel.

- One moment to focus on might be the "same wood" where they find themselves, the complaint that provokes agnition and which later provokes grief.

##Paragraph 6

6. _Knight's Tale: Ethical valences._

- By this choice, Chaucer probably wishes to suggest that __providence__ is equally shifting. Chaucer might equate our understanding of the two characters as identical, as perfectly replaceable, with our understanding of providence - it seems to change, but it doesn't.


- One might even say that the purpose of Chaucer's deployment of this trope is precisely to show how choice does not matter; how free will is an illusion set against the ultimately converging - levelling, unifying - forces of providence.

##Paragraph 7

7. __But__, we can also read the works as meditations on __translation__. Amis and amiloun and the context of translation.

	- Here we should bring __Cooper__ back

	- And Hiatt on genre and "romance" as the genre of translation and inclusion; and Field on the status of Middle English poem and the specific status of _Amis and Amiloun_.

- Not only does Amis and Amiloun exist in two, possibly connected, insular versions, an Anglo-Norman version and the Middle English one considered here; the story of the two identical friends had a vast continental genaealogy, from a Latin story dating from the eleventh century to "most of the written vernaculars of medieval Europe" [@LeSaux 1]. __The success of this story can perhaps be explained by considering this specifically transitional status; like the two friends, identical while apart, different and then restored, the narrative itself seems to have resulted successful in each of its incarnations, turning the hagiographical, topographically bounded narrative of the two lumbardian heroes Amis and Amiloun into an exemplary tale, useful in each of its incarnations._ As it was first translated into the French dialect spoken in Great Britain after the twelfth century, the story lost many of its specifically continental references, becoming a more generally applicable story. The identity between the two friends, later corrupt by the sin committed by one after the other, seems to correspond to the ideal correspondence existing between all these versions of the same narrative, possibly "lost in translation." Amis and Amiloun could therefore become a narrative about translation itself.

	- The story functions because the two friends are perfectly replaceable. Indeed, even sin is seemingly displaced, or translated, from one friend onto the other, possibly because the two are understood as being the same. But the fact that two different bodies, or signifiers, play the same role, or correspond to the same signifier, is possibly the element that triggers the nefarious disfiguration of one when compared to the other, and the fact that, when the two friends meet again, one is so disfigured that the other cannot recognize him. Like for its ethical contents, the translations of _Amis and Amiloun_ seem to frame a system and then systematically subvert it.

	- Describe how the leprosy changes the two initially identical signifiers. Compared to its Anglo-Norman equivalent, the Middle English version of the story expands on a narrative detail that might illuminate our perception of the economy of trasnlation in this story.

	- The plot motif that most easily relates to notions of translations and the displacement and identification of signs is certainly that of __agnition__. After having been apart for a long time, separated by the circumstances of fortune or providence, two characters meet again. Agnition usually corresponds to that moment of defaillance when the presence of this identifiable other shifts from unfamiliar to familiar. It is not simply a meeting of two friends long lost; it is their initial incapacity to recognize each other, followed by a moment of remembrance and recognition, that constitutes the trope. While the Anglo-Norman emphasized the violence of this instance, having Amiloun kick his transformed friend before hugging him sweetly, the Middle English operates a remarkable displacement of a small narrative detail, a cup carried by Amis as a sign that will allow their later identification.

	- The implication might be that prestige is now something that can be _bought_, it has been extended outside of the boundaries of aristocracy. It thematizes an economic, urban transaction replacing the traditional aristocratic agnition.

	- Not a very satisfying answer. The cup does in fact not solve the problem of agnition; instead, it triggers Amiloun's violent reaction against his friend. What solves the agnition is the voice of the loyal servant to Amis, "Oueis," who stops the punishment of his master and proves his real identity.

	- The poem therefore sets up a system where a literal and metaphorical translation are possible within a traditional economy of exchange and currency; but this is later challenged and subverted. _The function of the cup, that of allowing the two friends to be identified, is disproved._

	- Perhaps the ultimate answer that the romance suggests is that translation can only apparently function as a perfect economical system, but then forces it to its moment of crisis - a crisis that can only be solved by traditional means of reliance and honesty. __This might be the right moment for Trewthe and trewthe__ . At this moment of linguistic crisis, of linguistic adherence of the sign to reality, the poem reverts back to a traditional understanding of _trewthe_, the interpersonal loyalty between people, as if to suggest that, like in the story of Amis and Amiloun, signs can be exchanged without effort only to a certain extent (they are inferior to trewthe, like the economical, urban system described in the poem cannot ultimately replace trewthe).

	- The two ideas should be ultimately connected. The double system of loyalty and alliegiance, an ethical dilemma reversed and displaced onto the self in the conclusion of the poem, and the __translation__ of sin.

> Then was Amylion ferly woo;  
> Ffro his brother for to goo  
> Ever him was all his thought.  
> To a goldsmyth he went thoo,  
> And lete werke golde cuppys twoo  
> That for three hundred pound were bought.
> Both thei were of on wyght  
> And of on mykyll, y plyght;
> So quentelye thei were wrought,  
> In all thing were thei like, ywis,  
> As Amylion and sire Amys,  
> That thei laked ryght noght.

- One element to emphasize: the presence of a "goldsmith," the presence of an urban context, the emphasis on economic exchange, therefore compared to linguistic economy. _Economy makes translation and identity possible?_ 

	- While the Anglo-Norman version of the tale 

	- trewthe and trewe - loyal to a pledge and faithful to the actual truth

##Paragraph 8

8. And The Knight's tale in the context of translation.

- One option here might be to talk about how the tale has been adapted to become the romance told by the knight.

- __translation__ is important not only because this is _Teseida_, a boethian translation from Boccaccio, leading to the composition of Troilus and Criseyde, but also because it is greek history and classical antiquity. the idea is, again, that of translatio imperii. Does chaucer deploy the tropes of the double and agnition in the same way that we see in _Amis and Amiloun_, elaborating on ideas of potential substitution, replacement, and the misunderstanding of signs?

- sites of misunderstanding might be the prayers.

	- Perhaps we might say that the context had changed by the late xiv s., and the status of english had risen to be able to displace the authority and the prestige of the previous traditions, to displace italian, latin, greek.

	- Chaucer emphasizes the chronological and spatial distance of his source and matter in the first section of the poem.

##Paragraph 9

9. Conclusion.

__Two works__: options.

	1. Amis and Amiloun (doubled);
	2. Knight's tale (providence, religion interwoven; here the theme of doubling resonates with that of friendship, in a different context; adaptation and translation from the original);
	

__Envoy__: bisclavret.

##Structure

- Amis and Amiloun and Chaucer's _Knight's tale_ do similar stuff from an ethical perspective; they have two almost indistinguishable characters who are led to identity first, difference later - they seem to embody a sort of reaction to fate.

	- __But__, the two works could also be read as meditations on __translation__ and __glossing__; they both come from a continental tradition. Chaucer is adapting Boccaccio, he is also working along a line of __translatio imperiii__.

	One - Ethical doubt. Therefore, _Romance_ is the genre that enables us to confront ethical dilemmas.

		- In _Amis and Amiloun_, this ethical dilemma is also a dilemma of alliegiance - and transference of sin, vassalatic and not, from one body to the other. Do I owe my alliegiance to the king/the count/the vassalatic structure that I inhabit? Or do I owe my alliegiance to the god/to love/to friensdship?

		- In _Knight's tale_, the ethical dilemma is a retelling of Boethian providence. The idea is that the two friends are somehow indistinguishable, and confusing, because they are part of the same oneness - the same abstract, distant providence.

		- The trope - the __meme__, for _Helen Cooper_, of __oneness__ - of similarity, almost identity, is deployed as a  

	Two
