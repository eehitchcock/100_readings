Many of the works on this list have doubled or transformed masculine figures: a few examples are Amis and Amiloun, Guy before marriage and Guy after marriage, Tristan and Tristan l’Amerus, Palamon and Arcite, Arveragus and Aurelius. Choose two works from your list that are in the general vicinity of romance (avoiding, for example, Nicholas and Absolon from the Miller’s Tale) and examine how each work deploys its doubled masculine figures. For example—but your questions could well be different from these—How does the doubling facilitate or complicate each work’s potential for exemplarity? Does doubling express certain thematic tensions, such as between secular and religious imperatives? Does doubling explore a thematic interest in something beyond the plot itself, such as glossing or translation? No need to answer every conceivable question in your essay: the goal is to develop an analysis of the two chosen works that brings out each work’s particular qualities and strategies. In the course of your analysis, draw on two of the secondary sources for this part of the major list.

1. Introduction; the trope of identity as a sort of __meme__, a recognizable feature of the genre that exists somehow outside of it.

	- Cooper discusses how the function of __romance__ was precisely that of triggering ethical doubts; creating curiosity for interpretation; prompting interpretive problems and somehow asking the reader to identify with its characters. What happens when a reader - or a group of readers - are asked to identify with one character rather than two?

	- We can quickly bring in a number of secondary examples that will not be discussed - the recognizably linked __Floris and Blancheflour__, and some of the lais by __MdF__.

2. __Development__; __male frienship__. In two of the works that I have considered for this list, Amis and Amiloun and the Knight's tale, the trope - the __meme__, is deployed as a way to emphasize the ethical aspects of the story. Somehow a __doubling__ occurs for two distinct options - a __doubling__ that creates distinction after identity, and that serves an ethical purpose. (this is the end of the introductory section; here we state that: __one__, the doubling does ethical, pedagogical work; __two__, the doubling serves as a meditation on the linguistic, shifting identity of __romance__).

3. First example - Amis and Amiloun. (We only consider the Middle English at the moment). Focus on __form__; explain how this doubling is presented.

__Form__

- The Middle English _Amis and Amiloun_ deploys the traditiona tail-rhyme stanza as a way to exemplify and match the thematical importance of the theme of the double. In the first stanza of the poem, the two characters are first mentioned as "the childeryn twoo" that will become the subject of the narrative. The poet therefore chooses to name them by deployng a plural noun and a numeral, rather than their proper names. The actual names are first introduced in the fourth stanza, as a crucial piece of information that the narrator, nevertheless, prefers to postpone, creating a sense of expectation in the readers. As in the rest of the narrative, the two characters should first be understood as the identical, indistinguishable parts of the same whole, rather than as distinct individuals endowed with personal features. Moreover, the narrator chooses to deploy the very form of the tail-rhyme stanza as a way to underline the element of doubleness.

> In wele and woo how thei gone wende,  
> And howe unknow thei were of kende,  
> The berdes bolde of chere;
> And how thei were guode and hende,
> And how yong thei become frende,
> In courte where as thei were;
> And how thei were dobbid knyght,
> And how thei were trewth plyght,
> The childerin both in ffere;
> And in whate cuntre thei were born,
> And whate the children names weren:
> Hernkenyth, and ye may here.

[lexicon: berdes, youth; unknow: unrelated - they do not come from the same kin; bolde of chere means beautiful; hende means gracious, noble valiant; goude means good - it is a pure __hendyadis__;]

	- To do in this paragraph: explain first how the narrator is deploying twinning phrases __hendyadis__ (wele and woo; guode and hende)

	- Later in stanza 3 - the word "twoo" is repeated in an anadiplosis - as if the two characters themselves were born from this structural, verbal repetition.

	- Talk about the late introduction of __the names__ of the two characters.

	- How he is deploying the structure of the __tail-rhyme__ stanza as a way to formally imitate this doubleness.

	- Describe what happens in the tail-rhyme stanza as a system of oppositions: the stanza introduces some of the key terms around which the ethical doubts then shaped by the romance will take form - "friendship" and "courte" are two twinning obligations; mirrored then, in a sort of chiastic relationshio, in the "knyght and plyght" that follows. (the moments are in fact different - first the two children pledge _trouth_ to each other, stanza 13, l. 146; then they are dubbed knights, stanza 14, l. 164). It is important to keep them __separate__.


	- moments in the narrative that emphasize this __duplicity__ or __identity__.

	- __ethical__, moral, affective aspect; there is the __heart__ breaking in two.

4. Commentary:

	- Here we can stil use __cooper__: the __plot__ of __amis and amiloun__ follows the structure of a sequence of __dilemmas__ - literally, diadic options between two moral conducts, two alliegiances, two moral paths.

	- One is the __doubt__ at the end of the narrative - __replicated in the dreams of the two characters__; the other is the doubt 

5. Knight's tale; how the form emphasizes this break. (Does it?)

6. Ethical valences.

7. __But__, we can also read the works as meditations on __translation__. Amis and amiloun and the context of translation.

8. And The Knight's tale in the context of translation.

9. Conclusion.

__Two works__: options.

	1. Amis and Amiloun (doubled);
	2. Knight's tale (providence, religion interwoven; here the theme of doubling resonates with that of friendship, in a different context; adaptation and translation from the original);
	

__Envoy__: bisclavret.

##Structure

- Amis and Amiloun and Chaucer's _Knight's tale_ do similar stuff from an ethical perspective; they have two almost indistinguishable characters who are led to identity first, difference later - they seem to embody a sort of reaction to fate.

	- __But__, the two works could also be read as meditations on __translation__ and __glossing__; they both come from a continental tradition. Chaucer is adapting Boccaccio, he is also working along a line of __translatio imperiii__.

	One - Ethical doubt. Therefore, _Romance_ is the genre that enables us to confront ethical dilemmas.

		- In _Amis and Amiloun_, this ethical dilemma is also a dilemma of alliegiance - and transference of sin, vassalatic and not, from one body to the other. Do I owe my alliegiance to the king/the count/the vassalatic structure that I inhabit? Or do I owe my alliegiance to the god/to love/to friensdship?

		- In _Knight's tale_, the ethical dilemma is a retelling of Boethian providence. The idea is that the two friends are somehow indistinguishable, and confusing, because they are part of the same oneness - the same abstract, distant providence.

		- The trope - the __meme__, for _Helen Cooper_, of __oneness__ - of similarity, almost identity, is deployed as a  

	Two
